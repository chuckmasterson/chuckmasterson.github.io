### The Draw

Know what was the rock against which a lot of the hippies’ communes of the ’70s ran aground? It was
hard work. I read a book a while ago called *Back from the Land*, a reminiscence from an ex-hippie
turned English professor. Everywhere I turned in the book it seemed I found a story of how she and
her husband, or other hippie friends of theirs (who, she mentioned, are all now comfortably
ensconced in white-collar jobs), discovered that going back to the land involves physical labor.
That firewood doesn’t split itself, that building a house will sometimes leave you exhausted, that
farm animals make a lot of poop that you have to move. And it seems that the vast majority of them
said: “Well this sucks.”

I guess it makes sense that they all tossed aside their pitchforks. In the ’70s the journey was much
more about finding Utopia. The Dominant Paradigm was ruled by The Man, and the U.S. had just killed
hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese for no reason, and what we needed was a return to simpler times
and a simpler life. And then everything would be easier.

And when it wasn’t, well, what was the point then?

I’m coming to discover that in our day there’s a different breed of back-to-the-landers: less
numerous but also less susceptible to getting sidetracked right back onto the main line. They
understand that going back to the land isn’t something you do for *you*, it’s something you do for
the *land*. The crisis of our time isn’t mean politicians, it’s the fact that the Earth is
continually being abused, poisoned, and killed. You go out to the land to stop that from happening,
not to be able to smoke pot without hassles. 

That understanding instantly banishes the expectation that moving out to the country is a life
choice that will lavish upon you free time and enlightenment and a work week that consists of going
out and harvesting a ripe tomato to put on the burger you picked from your tempeh-burger tree. If
you’re going to feed yourself, you’re going to have to put in the time.

When you accept that, a curious thing happens. In the manner of a Taoist parable, once you start
putting in the hard work, you find that you believe deeply in the things you’re working on, so that
you can no longer imagine why anyone *wouldn’t* work as hard as possible toward these goals, and
you’re now happy to keep working. It stops feeling so much like work and starts feeling, at least on
the days when you’re able to let the Tao do the directing, like something new and exciting each day,
especially as your muscles get strong enough that the work is easier.

When I wrote my last post, Misty and I were halfway through a month at The Draw. Since then we’ve
gone back and finished the month, and reached an understanding of something like what I just
described there. Life at The Draw is physical. You get up before 7:00 and move a few wheelbarrows
from one place to another---full of cow shit, sheep shit, horse shit, at any rate something heavy
and likely fresh from the less pleasant end of an herbivore. Then the day seems to pass by in
a series of wheelbarrow loads and bucketsful of this and that, until you reach dinnertime, followed
shortly by bedtime, which in summer is often before the sun even sets. 

And yet, the whole time, if you can get a clear enough metaphysical vista on it, is suffused with
a beauty and a rightness, and that makes it so that you can see that much more clearly the joy of
the red-winged blackbirds flitting around the cattail marsh and the alders on your way to the barn,
or appreciate that third straight day of rain for the good it’s doing for the land.

And it’s not all work, anyhow. On nice days when there’s nothing urgent to do, whole afternoons are
given over to bike rides to the beach or walks down to the river. On rainy days, the work might
consist largely of peeling garlic and chatting. I’m told that in the winter there’s a lot of time to
sit and read. Lunch and dinner are slow and we spend a lot of time talking. (Amma and Ophelia, the
kids there (7 and 5), especially like the talking part. Though some would make the case that a more
appropriate word would be “arguing”.)

It took me some time to get to the point where I could see life’s deeper wholeness there more or
less clearly, though I could perceive it dimly from when I first stepped onto the land. Now
that I know what I’m looking at, though, living at The Draw seems like the single right choice we’ve
discovered so far in the endless sea of wrong choices that the usual cultural narratives keep trying
to funnel us into. Perhaps we’ll discover other places that seem as whole, or close. 

Not that I’m constantly in a nirvana state of satisfaction. When I work there, I get frustrated
sometimes. It seems at times that as soon as I think I’m done hauling stuff around and I can take
a breather for a few minutes, Nat has an idea for the next useful thing I could do, and I have to
just push myself along. Since I don’t have the workings of the whole homestead in my head yet, I’m
sort of limited to going with the flow of whatever’s happening there already, and often I can’t
conceive of what work is going to happen, so I kind of feel like an indentured servant. But as
I build up an understanding of the place, this would go away, and I would start making my own
decisions. Same would go for Misty. Nat has no interest in being the dictator of the place, it’s
just that he’s the only one who both knows enough to make intelligent decisions and doesn’t have
three children constantly hanging on him.

We can imagine living there for many years. We know, now, that at the end of our trip there is
somewhere where we’re welcome, somewhere we can be happy. We’re still allowing for the distant
possibility that some other even more amazing opportunity will present itself, but from where I sit
it doesn’t seem very likely.

### Nigigoonsiminikaaning

During the last few weeks I was in Minneapolis, Pebaamibines---the teacher at one of the Ojibwe
tables, and the one who invited us to [sugarbush]({% post_url 2017-03-16-2-the-sugar %})---invited
everyone to come up to Canada at the end of May, to the reserve he grew up on, to go on
a traditional four-day fast. This is part of Pebaam’s project to get as many people as possible
learning the wisdom of the old Anishinaabe way of life. Once you’ve gone for a fast and thereby
gotten to know the land up at Nigigoonsiminikaaning (Otter-Cub-Berry Patch)
