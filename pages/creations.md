### Stories

So I said I write stories, but so far there are just two here that I think are
decent enough to share. I’m slowly figuring out how to piece together the free
time to write in, so more will come.  

*   **[The Old Main
    Line]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/MainLine.pdf): **The pacing
    is a little odd, especially around the big blow-up, which was supposed to
    feel less sudden, and I’m not sure the underlying message came through that
    well, but all in all I like it. 25 pp., 2012.
*   **[What Happened
    Next]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/What Happened Next.pdf):** A short,
    weird little story about the internet. 5pp., 2015–16.

### Fonts

I’ve made some fonts!



*   [Newt
    Serif.](http://looseleaf.chuckmasterson.com/newt/) First one
    I finished and put up for sale. Whimsical serif.
*   [Solveig.](http://looseleaf.chuckmasterson.com/solveig/) Stressed
    sans-serif. Sort of like Optima but more interesting and a little less
    practical.
*   [Walleye.](http://looseleaf.chuckmasterson.com/walleye/) Text
    serif with a massive character set covering Cyrillic and polytonic Greek.

### T-shirts

During high school I discovered graphic design and started designing T-shirts,
and I put them up on CafePress. Many of them are amateurish, inexplicable, or
both, but there are some fun ones. In the olden days there were limitations on
how many shirts of any style you could sell in one store, so I started three
stores:



*   [**Permanent Marker**](http://www.cafepress.com/permanentmarker)
*   [**Permanent Mark 2**](http://www.cafepress.com/permanentmark2)
*   [**Permanent Mark 3**](http://www.cafepress.com/permanentmark3)

### Language Stuff

So, you know how a lot of academic writing is god-awful and full of
twenty-dollar words that you have to pick and slog through with a dictionary of
Latin and Greek word roots open on the table? 

Oh, you don't keep a dictionary of Latin and Greek word roots around? Well even
so, if you went to college you probably know what I'm talking about. When I was
in college I wrote a paper about those words and why they're so hard and what
could be done about it. I think it's a pretty decent and accessible paper;
I tried to make it an example of less obfuscated writing. If you'd like to read
it, it's here:

  English**](/assets/pdf/Big Words.pdf)

### Other Stuff

will appear here if I remember other neat stuff I’ve done that can be conveyed
to you via electron streams.
