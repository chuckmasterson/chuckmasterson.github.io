### Special moments.

Bits of music that always give me an involuntary spasm of being amazed.

1. Gustav Holst, _The Planets_, Mars. The moment is about 6½ minutes in,
   depending on the performance. All the chaos, built up the whole time by the
   5/4, yields into a long, warlike chord held by what sounds like the entire
   orchestra in fff, and then—here’s the part—the strings come in with a low
   note, and bend it up to their own long chord. That bend does it every time
   for me. Sadly, few orchestras play it that way—most play it as two separate
   notes, which just has no magic at all. I don’t know what the name of the
   orchestra is that plays the version I have. I wish I could help you with
   that.  [This uncredited performance has
   it.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0bcRCCg01I)

2. Flobots, “Handlebars”. The climactic verse where the song’s protagonist, who
   has been becoming steadily more corrupt and perverse for the entire song,
   shouts out,

   > And I can end the planet in a holocaust  
   > In a holocaust  
   > In a holocaust  
   > In a holocaust  
   > In a holocaaaaaaaaaaaust!

   And an entire crowd screams in unison behind him. And suddenly we flash back
   to when he could just ride his bike with no handlebars, and that’s the end.  

   [The music video enhances it even more.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuK2A1ZqoWs)

3. Jean Sibelius, _2nd Symphony_, Movement 2: Andante ma rubato. This entire
   movement comes close to that breaking point, but the spot is right at the
   end. The movement leaves room for you to breathe, or hold your breath, while
   you listen, and is painted with minimalist strokes of bright color. At the
   end, the orchestra has been getting quieter for a few minutes, and is
   winding down for the next movement. After a silence, the basses crescendo
   from nothing. The trumpets join them, and together they slowly go to two or
   three f’s. Then they stop in mid-air, they wait silently for you to move to
   the edge of your seat, and the trumpets blast their final three notes,
   falling away to nothing to let the srings quietly end the movement.  The
   movement is 15 minutes long, so it’s in three parts here. You really ought
   to listen to the whole thing. The conductor, Esa-Pekka Salonen, is feeling
   the music too. At one point he has tears on his face.
