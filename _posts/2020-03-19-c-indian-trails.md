If I was going to follow the hippie path of researching my way to harmony with the Earth, it was clear
that I would need to learn a bioregionally appropriate way of life from the indisputable masters of
bioregionalism: the native peoples of the land. 

I took it as foundational from the very beginning that I should learn to grow my own food. My teenage
and college-age reading into what’s wrong with the Earth, from writers as disparate as Derrick
Jensen and Wendell Berry, all seemed to agree on at least one main factor behind it all: growing
food far from where it’s eaten. So, like countless others before me, I started projecting my dreams onto
the backdrop of a plot of land somewhere in the country, where my garden would grow. But how,
specifically, would I grow it once I got there? 

I may have flirted briefly with the possibility of organic agriculture, but it never got much purchase
in my mind. In fact I really didn’t want to get very close to *agriculture* of any kind, organic or not.
My first countercultural readings, as a teenager who would believe almost anything as long as it was
printed in a serif font and sounded a little like what I wanted to hear, had been in primitivism: the
idea that humanity took a terrible wrong turn about ten thousand years ago, and it would be for the best
if we tried to go back and live more like we did before then. The inciting incident is supposed to have
been the creation of *agriculture*---from the Latin for ‘field growing’. It’s a nifty trick to cut down
an entire field of random forbs and sedges to replace it with a sweeping vista all planted in some crop
whose seeds you can eat. You can store up a lot of food that way. But you also reap a whole interesting
crop of whirlwinds. 

First you get unhealthy, because you’re only eating grains, and that’s not a way to be healthy. The
archaeological record shows that after agriculture first appeared in the Fertile Crescent, people in the
cultures that developed atop it began reaching adulthood six inches shorter, with weaker bones and more
malnutrition.[^jdm] Then you also get oppression, since storing of food allows controlling that food,
which in turn leads to a culture getting stratified into the farmers and the farmed-for.[^dq] Also you
get environmental degradation: slowly but surely, the irrigation-heavy agriculture between the Tigris
and Euphrates rivers salted the earth that it sprang from, and now the fertility of the crescent is
measured in lonely palm trees.[^jdc] Salinization isn’t the only way to ruin cropland. Repeatedly
tilling the land makes your topsoil wash away; soil in Iowa is in some places whole feet lower than
before agriculture got a hold of it.[^unk1] All told, agriculture came with enough bad sides that
I wasn’t interested in dirtying my hands in it.

[^unk1]: I read a vivid description once of the difference in height between an Iowa prairie remnant
    patch and the farms near it, but can’t find it anywhere. If I do, I’ll add it here.

This is an oversimplification. One of the classics of organic farming literature is *Farmers of Forty
Centuries*, the 1911 book by agronomist F. H. King[^fhk] that explained how Chinese and Japanese rice
paddies had managed to stay fertile for over four thousand years and counting. Likewise the primitivist
writings that led me to find condemnations of agriculture were oversimplified. They gave me a nice,
clean answer to all the problems I saw facing the world---agriculture did it!---and a nice, clean path
to travel, back to the Stone Age. The real world is much more complicated than single factors with
single solutions, which is why this essay is forty-two thousand words long. But many of the broad strokes of
the critique of agriculturally based civilizations still stood: tilling is still bad for topsoil and man
still can’t live very healthily on bread alone. So I was on the lookout for something to do on that
imaginary plot of land besides grow row crops.

I didn’t have to go far down the research path before I discovered a much more appealing way to work
with the land: permaculture. Where American organic farming seems mostly to settle for doing *less harm*
to the land, permaculture makes a goal of actively *improving* the fertility of the land.
Permaculturists (“permies”) are always talking about building topsoil, adding natural fertility,
sequestering carbon. The classic permaculture farm is a “food forest”, where the land is planted to
mimic the ecosystem that would grow there without human intervention, except that many of the
plants---from groundcover up to forest canopy---bear a crop that humans can eat, and other plants are
there to support those plants, and others are there for distracting crop-eating animals or attracting
game. Each farm has a different riotous, fractal complexity, springing from the ideas of the permie
running it and that person’s understanding of tiny minutiae of microclimate, soil conformation, water
drainage, and a galaxy of other things to pay attention to. To grow a farm that didn’t need to be tilled
and replanted every year, one where wild animals could not only live but thrive, one that did most of
its own work---*this* was a kind of food-growing I could imagine getting into.

It seemed like a revolution and a revelation, but of course it wasn’t really. Even the affable
Australians who coined the word *permaculture*, Bill Mollison and David Holmgren, admit that very
little of what permaculture proposes is new. It’s just old wisdom that’s been forgotten for a little
while, and the word *permaculture* is useful for grouping it all together where people can find it and
use it again. People styled “hunter-gatherers” and “nomads” have been using permaculture practices for
thousands of years. The various native nations of what’s now California, before the first
Europeans came, had been “tending the wild” since time immemorial: walking through the forest, pruning
low branches as they walked to improve the shade structure, intentionally planting useful trees in
useful places, culling trees they couldn’t use, and basically treating the entire rolling extent of
California’s forest lands as though it were an enormous garden that only needs replanting once
a generation or so.[^tw] A permaculture farmer I know in northern Wisconsin has a garden plot that
appears to float on top of the water, made of little artificial islands with food growing on them. He
calls it the *chinampa* garden, and the technique is a direct reproduction of the Aztec way of growing
food on lakes in what’s now Mexico. He says *chinampas* are the most productive kind of food-growing
arrangement ever invented. Outside of settlements and former settlements on the Amazon River you’ll find
mysterious patches of *terra preta*, ‘dark soil’, nearly black and extraordinarily fertile. It was
created over millennia of supplementing the poor local soil with charcoal, ground-up broken pottery, and
other ingredients not yet discovered. It makes beneficial microorganisms reproduce like crazy and has
the incredible ability to generate more *terra preta* if you leave a good amount of it when you take
some away to use as potting soil. Scientists do not fully understand its mysteries. It was invented by
horticultural Amazonian rainforest dwellers, who would have been called the lowest and meanest of the
human race by early Spanish missionaries.[^cc]

Maybe it’s my anthropology training, but it seemed to me that if I wanted to learn about indigenous
farming practices, the way to do it would be to actually learn from indigenous people. The trouble there
was, I lived in Ohio, one of the first parts of this country that settlers pushed Natives out of. There
are certainly some Shawnee and Miami people left, but most of them live in Oklahoma, and the ones who
are still in Ohio aren’t exactly all over the place. Having spent eighteen years growing up there, I had
never knowingly met one. Even if I did find a local Miami who cared to talk to a random Cincinnatian
city-boy such as me, and even if he knew a lot about traditional subsistence practices, the landscape of
Ohio is so transformed since 1800 that anything he could teach me would likely be nigh unusable anyway.

Luckily, I had a simple solution: I didn’t want to live in Ohio anyhow. Something about [that
transformed landscape]({% post_url 2018-05-16-play-catch-up %}#diagonal-walks). I couldn’t abide all
the quadrilaterals. Not to mention the pathetic winters: maybe one or two decent snowfalls all season;
two in every three Christmases entirely green. No, I was meant to be somewhere more northerly. My degree
secured, I spent a year teaching English in Korea to make just enough money to settle my student debts.
Then I finally lived my childhood dream: I spent a year and a half living from my backpack, hitchhiking
from one city to another, first in Europe and then more broadly in America, eating like a gourmet or
a starved raccoon from other people’s trash, blowing from one city to the next searching for somewhere
else to be from.

Once I got back to the U.S. I formed my master plan. Maybe it was because over the last sixteen months
I’d spoken or tried to speak Korean, Thai, Lao, Khmer, Mongolian, Russian, German, Portuguese, Spanish,
Catalan, French, Italian, and Welsh. I decided, now, that whenever I did find someplace where I wanted
to put down roots, I would solidify that commitment by learning whatever language was spoken there
before settlers came. In so doing I would achieve several things at once. For one thing I’d be
consciously and specifically acting as a stick in the mud against the constant and harmful current in
American culture that says the best place to be is somewhere else just down the road. If I wanted to
live well with the Earth, I had to start by living *with* the Earth, and that meant staying in one
place, reaching my toes down into the soil, and letting them root out around me. By doing something as
unfashionable and unmodern as sitting down and learning one of North America’s famously knotty and
thorny autochthonous langauges in all its complexity, I’d convince myself that I could stay somewhere
long enough to make it home, and show people around me that even the bits of the past that we imagine to
be quite well buried are in fact still right there when you look, and have a lot to teach us.

Then, too, I wanted to learn about the history of the place I was in, the real, deep history, not just
the last two hundred years or so since the first white people showed up and started cutting down all the
trees and building military forts. Perhaps I wouldn’t pick up history just from studying grammar
patterns, but it seemed like I couldn’t fail to pick up a good amount of it in whatever I would read
while learning, not to mention from the people I would learn with. 

And I wanted to make a gesture of reverse-colonialism: my ancestors’ countrymen made yours learn
English, and to take a small step toward making things right, I’ll learn your language. It was
interesting to me that when I mentioned my plan of learning Ojibwemowin to white people, many of them
assumed that this was my main or sole reason for doing it. As if it were a form of penance. *Forgive me,
father, for my ancestors have sinned. --- Memorize one hundred conjugations and you shall be absolved.*

{% include fig.html src="wintry-bits-1428" class="right" %}

But I don’t really find white guilt a useful motivator. Above and beyond all those other factors, I was
moved by the sheer delight of learning the language itself. People who “aren’t language people” (“Yeah,
I took four years of Spanish in high school... all I remember is, ‘Dawndeh estuh el banjo?’ ”) seem to
imagine that learning another language is good for nothing but toil, all *amo, amas, amat, amamus* until
you might as well be in a medieval scriptorium. But I’ve spent a fair deal of time with languages and
I can say with confidence that they are utterly fascinating and any effort you put in is rewarded if you
keep a curious and wondering mindset.

I was looking for spirits, perhaps---but only the kind you find peopling any language. The ghosts of
speakers long departed. Take a close look at English. Whose original stroke of genius was it to take the
word *spring*---which started out meaning just ‘jump’---and apply it to a *spring*, where the water
jumps up out of the ground, or to the *springtime*, when plants jump right up from seed? Who decided to
name a bright red bird after Catholic *cardinals* with their bright red vestments? Linguists are at
a loss to explain why exactly English has so many words for how light plays off a reflective
surface---*gleam, glare, glimmer, shimmer, sparkle, shine*---when most languages get by with one or two.
It’s not as if there’s something specifically about the British Isles that should’ve made people
unusually sensitive to reflectivity. So they’ll say that it’s just down to happenstance. To which
I might say: why *just* happenstance? Some people in our linguistic lineage decided to maintain a lot of
different words for scattering light, and who knows why, but the rest of us seem to have liked those
words enough to have kept them alive for several hundred years, so why not own that act of creation and
maintenance as one more peculiar thread in the peculiar tapestry of English? 

Even when we know why some odd word arose---like how you can *eighty-six* something while cleaning your
garage because short-order cooks in the ’50s had a cryptic numerical code to communicate with waitstaff,
in which *86* meant ‘we’re all out!’[^sd]---it somehow only adds depth to what feels, if you pay
attention to it, almost like what Jung and Lévy-Brühl called “mystical participation”[^ms1]---the sense
that you’re not the only one thinking your thoughts, but only, as it were, thinking them on behalf of
a much larger consciousness. So even if [Sapir and
Whorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapir–Whorf_hypothesis) were wrong (as many of the more respected
linguists now say)[^jm] and the words we use *don’t* dictate the thoughts we’re able to think---even if
we can use any language equally well to formulate any thought---it seems beyond question, at least to
me, that the language we use will at the very least give those thoughts a background of *flavor*, which
can be disregarded by the most workmanlike communicators but is always there to taste if the poet in you
cares to use your tongue for more than just talking.

    Whorf didn’t really hold this hypothesis themselves, but their names are well known in connection 
    to it and serve as a peg to hang this particular hat on.

And so, what might be there to discover in an indigenous language of North America, whose generations in
bygone centuries led lives so different from the lives of the Anglo-Saxons who were, in the same
centuries, busy using and passing on the words I’m currently writing? Those were the kind of spirits
I was hoping to discover whenever I finally finished breezing from one place to another and found the
one I wanted to call home.
