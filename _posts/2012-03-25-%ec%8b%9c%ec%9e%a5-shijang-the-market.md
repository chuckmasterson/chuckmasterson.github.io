I know I still need to put up the photos from my southeast Asia adventure.
That’s a particular task that’s huge enough that I just
haven’t tried yet. Soon! But meanwhile, I finally took some pictures at
the market today. I don’t know if I’ve mentioned it before, but
I’m crazy about this market. It comes every 5th and 10th day of the
month, and I go every time. There’s just so much interesting stuff. I
could spend the whole rest of the year trying to learn how to use the stuff
they sell here, and I probably wouldn’t even get halfway. Not that
that’s going to keep me from trying. 



{% include fig.html src="Sijang 001.jpg" %}

Every market day, the market takes over this street in town. It mainly has 
restaurants and textile stores otherwise.


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 003.jpg" %}

Perhaps not the best thing to show first, but this is 순대 *sundae*, which 
is not at all like an ice cream sundae. It’s sausage made of rice and
blood, and it’s usually served in a soup with offal. I decided to try a
new food for my birthday, so I went to a restaurant and had this soup, known as
순대국밥 *sundae gukbap.* And actually it was really tasty. Since living
in Korea I fear eating almost nothing anymore. Though this market still
contains some of the things I haven’t yet accepted.


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 004.jpg" %}

Here’s a better image of the market. Three old ladies sitting there on 
the road selling their stuff. When not talking to a customer, they talk to each
other, and it must be funny stuff because they laugh a lot. I don’t know
most of the stuff they’re selling—they’re some of the many vendors
who sell unidentifiable roots whose uses I have no idea about—but the one in
the front on the right side is very persistent in selling her stuff, and
finally convinced me to buy something I didn’t quite understand today.
It’s 냉이 *naeng’i*, which apparently is known in English as
shepherd’s-purse and is a weed. What you do with it in Korean cuisine is
you stick it in your 된장찌개 (*doenjang jjigae*, soybean paste soup).
I’ve made *doenjang jjigae* before with mild success, but maybe the
*naeng’i* will give it that magic something.


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 005.jpg" %}

Here’s a vegetable stall. On the floor, foreground to background, we 
have: spinach and ginger; lotus roots; daikon radishes (in the plastic basket);
scallions; something that I think is seaweed; and then everything is too far
away. On the table the only thing you can see is cabbage, the kind they use to
make kimchi.


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 006.jpg" %}

This is the same vendor, a little further down the table. Here we have various 
mushrooms (*paeng’i*, one whose name I don’t know, and
*pyogo*, known in English by the Japanese name *shiitake* because the
Japanese introduced us to them first) and peppers and cucumbers, and then below
that some spinach and some stuff I don’t know and some regular old onions
(and garlic, I think), and then on the ground broccoli and a bunch of stuff
that I can’t explain. 


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 007.jpg" %}

Here’s another vendor. I think in the front is some different kinds of
rice. Next to that is 취나물 (*chwinamul*), which is an aster that grows
in the mountains. They dry it out, and then you take it home and boil it or
something, and it’s a side dish. I may not have mentioned, but Korean
cuisine is big on side dishes. Almost every meal comes with an array of them,
known as 반찬 *banchan*, all spread out in little three-inch bowls. At the
very least you’ll almost always get some kimchi. Though it’s not
always cabbage kimchi—kimchi is more of a method of preparation than it is a
specific dish. With *sundae gukbap*, you’ll always get daikon radish
kimchi, and some people pour the kimchi juice into the soup. I tried that
before I finished the soup yesterday, and it was indeed delicious. Behind the
*chwinamul* is something that was described to me as medicinal, not food;
and further back you can see things like chestnuts, unidentifiable roots, and
garlic. 

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 008.jpg" %}

In the front we have more of that medicinal stuff, and more *chwinamul*
and some peanuts, and then you’ll notice a bunch of sticks. They sell a
lot of sticks and wood at the market. I think I finally figured out
what’s going on with that. The other day Sean brought me up a little
sealed bag that he’d found somewhere, the kind they use to package candy
in the States, with a woodchip and some dried-up roots inside it. It was marked
백숙 (*baeksuk*), and I looked this up and found out it’s a style of
cooking known as something like “white cuisine” (*baek* is the
Chinese root for “white”). White is the color of purity and
cleanness here, and *baeksuk* gets its name by involving only a few
ingredients. In the case of the bag Sean had brought me, the recipe goes like
this: Boil some water for 40 minutes with the woodchip and the roots in it.
Then put a chicken in there and boil it for 30 more minutes. Then take the
woodchip out before you eat it. (I’m not sure about the roots.) But it
still seems like they sell an awfully high volume of sticks and wood. Either
*baeksuk* is a lot more popular than I realize, or there’s some
other use for the sticks and wood, or the vendors just bring lots of the stuff
every time because it never goes bad. Further on beyond the sticks in this
picture are chestnuts, various beans, eggs, fern sprouts, and vegetables I
don’t know.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 009.jpg" %}

Same vendor, different vantage point. Here are peanuts, and then lots and lots
of different kinds of beans, none of which are regular old kidney beans that
you might use to make chili or a Cincinnati 5-way. The bottle on the far left
probably has homemade sesame oil, and on the ground are more unidentifiable
roots.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 010.jpg" %}

On the top row, only halfway in-frame, are: fern sprouts, unidentifiable roots
in a bag, *naeng’i*, peanuts, and probably parched sesame seeds in
those little bags. Then there are some vegetables that I should really learn
because they look tasty. And then garlic, chestnuts, possibly peppercorns, and
jujubes on the far right.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 011.jpg" %}

Then we get to the fish section. It’s only recently that I dared to enter
here, but my school lunches have featured some fish prepared in actually pretty
tasty ways, and I decided that being able to cook fish would actually be a
pretty darn useful life skill. So I got some fish from this very vendor and
fried it up breaded in a Korean style that I found explained on the internet.
Sean was there when I did this, which was handy since he’s cooked fish
before and was able to give me advice on how not to ruin it. We both agreed
that the fish was amazing fried this way. I’ll make it at Crowduck. 


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 012.jpg" %}

I really don’t understand most of what happens in the ocean. I
don’t know what any of the stuff on the left is, and I can’t tell
you anything about the dried fish on the right except that they’re dried
fish. 

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 013.jpg" %}

Crabs, mussels, and different mussels. They use mussels in Korean soups. The
thing is, they leave them in the shells. It’s your responsibility to dig
them out from the bottom where they’ve sunk and then use your
chopsticks—never your fingers, you mustn’t touch your food!—to get the
meat out.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 014.jpg" %}

In the front, dried fish; in the back, seaweed sheets, which you can use to
make sushi, or, far more likely, 김밥 (*gimbap*), which is shaped like
sushi but has ham and vegetables and egg in it instead of fish.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 015.jpg" %}

Beyond the seaweed sheets, there’s this. Foreground row: raisins,
peanuts, and I guess different peanuts. Next row back: almonds, jujubes,
walnuts, pine nuts and behind them peppercorns, and some kind of fish patties I
think. Maybe squid. And in the tubs in the back are some kind of black bean or
something, then I think squash seeds, and then sunflower seeds.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 017.jpg" %}

And then beyond that we get back into fish. The foreground row is just a bunch
of different sizes of dried anchovies. The bigger ones are good for making
broth, and the smaller ones get cooked up in some sesame and soy sauce and
stuff and just eaten straight as a *banchan*. Behind the anchovies are
fish broken into little pieces. The far left stuff may actually be squid.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 018.jpg" %}

I’m no fishologist, but I think these ones in the front are flounders and
then clearly some kind of stingray or skate. 

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 019.jpg" %}

Alright, some vegetables! In front are beansprouts in the metal bowls and
spinach in the boxes; behind them more scallions (these are a very popular food
here), various unknowns, and I think the hulking black mass is kelp; and on the
table in back are Korean radishes (무 *mu*), further scallions, Western
cabbage, garlic stems (마늘쫑 *maneul jjong*, which make a very tasty
*banchan*), and stuff too far away to make out.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 020.jpg" %}

*Naeng’i* and *chwinamul* are the only things I can identify
here. The bottle is some kind of oil, though it originally held soju. Soju
bottles are very widely reused here. They use them not only for homemade oils,
but also at restaurants to serve water in. Why waste?

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 021.jpg" %}

This is my favorite vendor. The little old lady who runs it—not the one in the
picture, she’s just a customer, and the vendor is even littler and
older—is really cheerful and cute and always gives me free little bonuses, like
a bag of beansprouts or a thing of *paeng’i* mushrooms. I think she
once said she was thrilled that I like to cook Korean food. Although
she’s not the only one who gives me free stuff. There’s a fruit
vendor toward the beginning of the market whose stall I didn’t take a
picture of, mainly because the fruits he sells are all pretty familiar to
anyone reading this, stuff like bananas and strawberries and cherry tomatoes.
During the fall he would give me a really hearty “Hello, Naych!”
and a bunch of free Concord grapes pretty much every time I came down, even
though I hardly bought any fruit from him and the grapes weren’t terribly
cheap. Just today, his wife, who fries up seaweed sheets at the stall next
door, gave me an absolutely free tupperware full of a *banchan* made of
some kind of marinated paper-thin-sliced sweet squid. It’s pretty
delicious. If I understood right, she gave it to me because I showed her the
*naeng’i* that I bought, and that means only one thing, soybean
paste soup, and she said this squid stuff is a perfect *banchan* to have
with soybean paste soup. And when I come back on Friday she’s going to
give me some kimchi. For my part I’m going to try to need some fruit, so
I can buy it from the man. 

Anyhow, the lady running the stall in the picture (had you forgotten that this
is a caption?) also has everything. In the picture above are mainly a lot of
things I’ve covered before, plus carrots and some rice-based things in
the very foreground. But the pictures below are her stall too. 

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 022.jpg" %}

In this one is acorn gel (you can see 도토리묵 *dotorimuk* on the sign),
behind it sweet corn bread, and next to it some things I don’t know.


{% include fig.html src="Sijang 023.jpg" %}

And here, amid her collection of candy, are the *beondegi*, the silkworm
pupae, seen here waiting in boiling water for hungry customers. I sent them as
a joke Christmas present to Grandpa, but over here people eat them with
completely straight faces. 

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 024.jpg" %}

If I wanted a house plant, I would know exactly where to go. Maybe some of
these are even edible in some way.

{% include fig.html src="Sijang 025.jpg" %}

Lastly, here’s a place I patronize pretty much every time I come down,
because it gives me instant gratification. This guy sells: two kinds of donuts,
one that’s just dough and one that’s full of sweet red bean paste;
shishkabobbed chicken; corn dogs (next to his hand in this picture), which are
usually served covered with sugar, mustard, and ketchup; 돈까스
*donkkaseu*, which are ground pork patties on sticks and probably really
bad for me; and some kind of popcorn chicken things that I’ve never
tried. In the foreground is the 어묵 *eomuk* station. *Eomuk*, as
near as I can tell, is pulverized fish that’s agglutinated into
cardboard-thickness sheets. Here they cut strips of it and spear it
zigzaggingly onto these long sticks. Then they put the sticks into boiling
chicken broth. It’s actually not too bad, though certainly not my
favorite thing in the market. You eat it with a cup of broth (someone’s
in the midst of scooping a cup right now in the picture) and some soy sauce
sprayed on from a spray bottle.

So now you know where it is that I’m shopping every week. Russell read my
blog when I said I was only going to shop at the market, and said, “Why
don’t you just handcuff yourself?” But now it should be clear that
I’m not going wanting for anything by shopping only there. (Though he may
have been talking about the admittedly restrictive schedule.) The only problem
I’ll have is that there’s just too much food for me to understand
it all. 

I asked one of the vendors today for a little more background on it. How long
has it been going on? “Since old times,” he said, and it’s
always been every day of the month that ends in 5 or 0. Where does the food
come from? He told me that it’s too cold to grow anything around here at
the moment, so the food all comes from Seoul, and before that it comes from
Busan or Jeju. Some of the stuff comes from China, like the huge carrots. But
during the growing season, there’s tons of stuff from right around here,
from local farms. Honestly, when I get back to the States, it’s going to
be pretty hard to adjust to supermarkets being the only place to get food. The
market is an endlessly fascinating and puzzling place and probably my favorite
part of this whole town.

P.S.: I had a great birthday, and I’ll probably go into more detail next
time I write—just so you know I didn’t forget about it.
