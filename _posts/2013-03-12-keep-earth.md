  *Note from 2017. I'm somewhat disillusioned with large-scale organizing in
  the style of 350; it feels like it's missing something. I wouldn't preface this
  to say I disagree with some things I said, since I would have to preface half
  my older posts, but in this case I felt uneasy about it even while I was
  writing.  While I'm still obviously in favor of not wrecking the Earth, I felt
  and still feel that this post was forced and perfunctory, a way to prove to
  myself that I was really a Good Environmentalist.*

I went to Washington, DC. So far I’ve mentioned practically nothing about
it, and it’s almost as if I hadn’t gone there at all, and I
can’t have that happening, because while I was there I was taking part in
something very, very big that I don’t want to go down in vague memory as
just another one of those things that I’ve done, or “one of those
exploits he’s always going on”, with none of the reason or meaning
behind it ever being heard. So, I went to Washington, DC, to be one of
somewhere north of thirty-five thousand people taking part in the
country’s biggest ever gathering about climate.  Climate change has
become pretty obvious, what with the vanishing of Arctic Ocean ice, the
unprecedented amount of calving of Antarctic glaciers, the droughts in the
US’s breadbasket, the repeated superstorms demolishing large parts of
coastlines, and of course the record high temperatures everywhere. I take the
argument over whether it’s human-caused to be pretty well settled too: to
think climate is, on its own whim, going haywire and doing these things
that are completely out of the ordinary, as defined by all the records we have,
is to believe that there’s an incredible coincidence going on—on the one
hand, climate change; on the other hand, levels of carbon dioxide in the air
that Earth hasn’t experienced since three million years ago, when there
were still rabbits the size of dogs and beavers the size of motorcycles and
woolly rhinoceroses roaming around. And yes, animals did flourish back then as
well as they do now, but the climate changed *slowly* to that level, and they
had time to evolve to cope with it. 

So climate is important. That’s why all of us gathered on the National
Mall next to the Washington Monument that day. And it must be one of the
biggest crowds I’ve ever been in, second only perhaps to Oktoberfest, and
at Oktoberfest it’s not like all those drinkers milling about were a
unified whole gathered to demand something important. All of us there came
together and told Obama and Congress and the country, unequivocally, that
carbon emissions have to stop. Who knows how they estimate this, but we were
told from the stage at the front that our numbers had just been estimated at
thirty-five thousand, which I might add is roughly the population of the
country of Monaco. We were crammed in so tight that, with my backpack on, I
couldn’t even walk anywhere, just gradually shift with the crowd wherever
it undulated.

Our focus of the day was something known as the Keystone pipeline. It’s
not the only thing that’s threatening the atmosphere, nor is it
even the biggest, but it is probably the biggest thing that can be stopped
at a stroke, and that means that at least for now it’s what the climate
movement is aiming everything in their arsenal at and also what they’re
rallying around. The big idea of this pipeline is to take oil from the tar
sands in remote Alberta all the way across the US to Texas and a few other
refinery-type destinations. And that’s a problem. In all sorts of ways.
First off, and this is the big thing, the tar sands represent a titanic amount
of oil, billions of barrels, and if it all comes out of the ground, it will, of
course, get burned, and go into the air, right while we’re trying to get
civilization to power itself in other ways and get itself off this heroin drip
of oil that it’s been mainlining for the last century. Bill
McKibben, possibly the most prominent leader in the environmental movement
these days, commissioned a series of calculations on how much oil is left in
the world and how much warming that represents, and the results were bleak.
Some warming is already a foregone conclusion -- it’s already
happened, in fact -- but scientists have figured that if the warming can
be kept to 2°C, then the world will escape the most cataclysmic of its effects.
Unfortunately, it turns out that, even though the world is running out of oil,
what oil we have left is about five times more than enough to take us beyond
that benchmark and through a positive feedback loop into a transformed, quite
possibly largely uninhabitable world. That’s why every drop of oil that
we can keep in the ground is a victory.

This is what people mostly already knew when they came to the rally, and
it’s what brought a lot of them from everywhere in the country. I was
with a crowd of Ohioans, and nearby I saw a crowd of Iowans; there were plenty
of Texans, probably a sizable contingent from North Dakota (another place where
the oil companies are hard at work gutting the Earth and pulling tar sands out
of it), and enough people to power a loud cheer even when Bill McKibben asked
for one from only those who had bussed at least 36 hours to get there. 

And people came up on the stage to speak, and we heard what I’ve
just said about Keystone, but we also heard some new things, things that I
didn’t know.  Athabaskan leaders came up to the microphone. They told us
first-hand what tar sand excavation does to the Earth. They’ve been
living in their corner of Alberta a hundred times longer than there’s
been such a thing as “Alberta”. A few years ago, oil companies came
and plowed scars of gravel through their hunting lands, then put up signs
warning not to go beyond this point. Of course they never asked permission from
the First Nations people. Once they were in, they started taking out the tar
sands. Imagine a hole the size of a city, as if an antimatter bomb with the
force of multiple nukes had been dropped. Inevitably, the pipeline spilled, and
now the muskeg -- the swamp that’s feet thick with pure life and
forms the basis of the First Nations’ subsistence and medicine and in
fact their entire culture -- has been poisoned and killed. The oil
company responsible released a contrite statement, acted like they were
cleaning it up for a few weeks, and then quit even pretending they cared. The
oil still hasn’t gone away, though.

Texans and Oklahomans came to talk too, farming folks whose land the oil
companies are trying to eminent-domain away, even though the companies are
Canadian and even if they were American there would be no legal basis for
forcing the farmers out. A multibillionaire investor came up and told us that
besides everything else, Keystone was also flat-out a bad investment, with an
almost negligible return on investment.

And we learned that the fight against it is, despite all the oil
companies’ best efforts, alive and massive and being waged in every way
possible. The First Nations are asserting their long-trampled treaty rights,
and the southern farmers are refusing to let eminent domain put the
pipeline through their land. Where the law has failed, at the ends of
pipeline still under construction, people have devised ways of climbing inside
the pipe and fastening themselves to it, so the companies can’t construct
any further. And of course, there was us: thirty-five thousand people standing
next to the Washington Monument to tell Obama that approving the pipeline would
be indefensible, and that his historical reputation will be based on what he
did or didn’t do on this issue, and for the environment, at the biggest
physical tipping point humans have ever seen. 

We marched right up to his house to tell him all that. Of course, he was off at
the moment golfing with oil executives. Absolutely serious. The gates of the
White House were only a photo op, and a symbolic gesture. But it’s not
like the rally passed silently and no one noticed it. Obama obviously heard
about it, and so did Congress, and it actually made news stories in big
newspapers, despite our pessimism about corporate money--controlled media. (I
guess we were big enough that ignoring us would’ve been even more
conspicuous than running a modest story about the country’s
biggest-ever climate rally.)

That was partially what we were about when we got together: being a great,
unified voice to make not a request but a demand to stop the cataclysm. But of
course, that’s a goal that can easily be met with complete stonefacedness
from the government. There was another thing we did that day that we
couldn’t fail at, simply by virtue of being so many people all standing
there even against the cold of that February day. We became a movement. Rather
than a miscellany of discrete groups with varying strategies and aims and
memberships, we were now -- Sierra Club, 350.org, Yinka Dene Alliance,
Friends of the Earth, random unallied floaters like me -- all one whole.
This is how the civil rights movement became something that accomplished goals,
and also the women’s suffrage movement, and the peace movement. And we
even have advantages that they didn’t -- new ways to communicate,
and the inexhaustible well of knowledge on the internet.  It’s a good
thing we do, because our enemy is also tougher. Oil companies, which are made
of money and thus made of power, are more potent than simple non-fiscal racism
or misogyny ever was, and probably stronger than the disorganized if
enormous group of companies that demanded more war to fuel their weapon-making
or Humvee-making profits. Oil can buy advertising, pay enormous sums to people
who are willing to rape the Earth in North Dakota and Alberta, and make people
want the same goals as they do with a simple twitch of gasoline prices. It will
take almost infinite cleverness and determination from this movement to defeat
that kind of force. But from what I saw from the people who talked that day,
and at the people’s congress afterward, and the talk that night about
native lands, that’s something that this movement may very well actually
have.

For the moment, the outlook has turned against us. John Kerry approved a
statement to the effect that the pipeline will have a negligible effect on the
environment. Obama hasn’t decided yet. But nothing is final yet, and in
fact never will be. Even if the strategy of being where Obama is, carrying a
no-pipeline sign every time he steps out of his car, fails; even if the
Canadian government rules that the treaties with the Yinka Dene Alliance are as
worthless as every other ironclad treaty they’ve signed with First
Nations; even if the government kicks all the farmers off their land and keeps
them off with military force; even if enough guards are emplaced to keep people
who are willing to lay down their physical bodies for the fight from
shackling themselves into the pipeline; even if it gets completed and goes
operational; we’re still a movement, and we’ll still fight it, and
it’s still a fragile artificed object that will, through immediate force
or through the gradual working of time, will die. Other things will need to be
stopped, and we’ll stop them too. As long as there’s a living
planet, we’ll never quit.

I wrote this in large part for myself. I went, and I left, and that day started
fading like memories do. I still have exploring left to do, and I haven’t
figured out what exactly I can contribute to the environmental movement
once I do stop being no more than a vagabond, but I had to remind myself
that I can never allow it to be nothing.
