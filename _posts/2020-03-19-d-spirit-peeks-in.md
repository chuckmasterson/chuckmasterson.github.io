My first sight of Minneapolis was from the car of a jovial Ojibwe woman who had picked me up outside the
city and brought me to the Phillips neighborhood, and my first experience of the Native community there
was when she dropped me off outside the Hi-Lake liquor store, pointed to a guy, and said, “Look, there’s
an Ojibwe now! You can tell because he’s got no butt!” I had heard good things about the city, and over
the next few days it grabbed the heart of this gnarly vagabond. On the basis of little more than a nice
bike ride around the city with an old college crush, an evening in one of the many fine South
Minneapolis community houses, and a bookstore where the prominently displayed books were about how to
forage wild edible plants, I moved there. I had seen enough to know the place felt right. I was as free
of personal connections in town as a Swedish immigrant freshly arrived from Ellis Island. But like that
Swede, I found I did know some people who could help me get situated after all. A college friend of mine
recommended I call Erica, a college friend of hers who I’d never known. Erica was living in a community
house, and one of the few firm convictions I held at the time was that, for however long I was going to
live in a city, I wanted to live in community. I had barely been in Minneapolis three weeks and already
it seemed things might be coming together.

The first time I visited Sprout House was during their weekly open-to-the-community morning meditation.
I skipped the meditation that day because meditation smelled too much like woo-woo; I came to the
breakfast afterwards instead. There was a painting of a lotus blossom on the wall, and one attendee was
a guy sitting on the living room floor wearing a wire-frame pyramid on his head. He said it helped
concentrate energy into him. I immediately began developing misgivings. I’ve always been severely
allergic to woo-woo. But the Sprouts clarified that going to meditation was entirely optional. Also, the
pyramid-head guy didn’t actually live there. (I only ever saw him one more time, in passing.) And I had
to admit everyone there seemed like great people. So I moved in.

Before focusing on learning indigenous language and land practices, it was time for me to just get the
hang of living in a community house. Sprout House had a fluctuating membership of eight to ten people
spread among the four floors of a huge duplex, with similarly fluctuating food-share systems and chore
rotations. Part of a natural lifeway was the extended family unit. This was a pretty good facsimile of
that arrangement, and also a decent approximation of some of the hippie communes, in case I wanted to
learn experientially where they went wrong. Mostly, though, it was a nice place to live, where I had
good friends just in the next room and the rent was cheap.

During the time I’d spent hitchhiking around the continent, I’d comfortably put the question of
spiritual matters on the back burner, and besides the odd frisson of otherworldliness I got when
entering, say, Notre Dame Cathedral, it seemed those questions were content not to raise themselves. But
after a short while at Sprout House, I noticed that everyone but me, in some way or another, seemed to
be seeking some kind of spiritual understanding of the world. Much of the house was Buddhists, and they
had close ties to a local meditation center that people from the neighborhood attended on Sunday
mornings just like church. One housemate, Sucharit, practiced a spinoff of Hinduism that he’d picked up
back home in India called Ānanda Mārga, and would fill the house with the sound of his harmonium as he
chanted *Bābā nām kevalam.*

And what’s more, none of them seemed actively crazy or ignorant. Sucharit had a doctorate in something
like neurology, and was so unafraid of letting science get a hold of his religion that he was doing
a research project involving brain scans of meditating people. Nobody tried to tell me that the Buddha
created the Earth in seven days, or that if I didn’t meditate regularly I would go to Buddhist Hell.
They just told me that meditating was a good way to get in touch with deeper parts of your being and
different ways of understanding the world. They all had different ways of explaining what these deeper
parts were---Emily might say they were mostly the subconscious; Makai might call the same thing the
spirit; Sucharit called it all different aspects of Bābā, the one spirit or principle that underlies and
pervades the universe. But all the different words they used seemed congruent, and none of them asked me
to believe things that were provably false. And thus, with a mix of thrill and alarm, I realized there
might be something out there called a religion that I could actually take seriously.

So I took some tentative steps into the water. I started meditating---very irregularly---and I even got
something out of the experiment, though I would’ve been hard pressed to tell you what. Somewhere I found
a copy of the *Tao Te Ching*, and found that it was not a bundle of dubious just-so stories, but
a collection of levelheaded and deeply observant meditations on why the world is the way it is, and what
we can do about that. Ideas like the *Tao*’s “Obedience to law is the dry husk of loyalty and good
faith”[^t38] and the Buddha’s “Attachment is the root of suffering”,[^bda] once I understood them,
explained a lot of life’s joys and pains---in a way I’d never seen science attempt. It was almost,
I thought, as if religions didn’t set out to be scientifically accurate geobiological histories.
Perhaps, I thought, they had entirely different goals from the very beginning. *And a million imaginary
theologians shouted, “Duh!”* I revised my definition of *religion* to allow that some of them were in
fact solid moral frameworks for navigating life.

This, in a way, solved two problems at once for me. On the one hand, it made believing in a religion at
least admissible for me to consider, now that I’d found some things called religions that had helpful
lessons and that I couldn’t dismiss out of hand. On the other, it put me within sight of a bridge,
between taking nature as a guide on one hand, and on the other our puny human understanding of what
nature is actually like.

I’d always gotten my morality from nature, or at least fancied that I had. To my mind, it was the only
possible legitimate source for moral guidance. Even as a nominally Christian child, I discounted the Ten
Commandments from the beginning. Honor thy mother and father. What if thy father be a wife-beating
heroin junkie? But in nature all morality is decided on a case-by-case basis. Any decision or action is,
at its most natural, like a patch of moss that happened to grow a certain way, from a tree that happened
to grow on a nurse log, which happened to fall a certain amount of time ago, in a forest that happened
to grow on a rainy coast, which happened to form by tectonic motion a certain number of eons in the
past. Nothing is not contingent; no decision can be made without context, and the context for any
decision is the entire universe. Yet without benefit of hard-and-fast rules, the moss is doing just what
it should be doing. (As Lao Tzu would say, “Not one of the ten thousand things / fails to hold the Way
sacred / or to obey its power.”)[^t51] 

[^t51]: Le Guin *op cit.*, ch. 51.

The trouble is that once you bring human consciousness into the picture, suddenly instead of just doing
what nature would have you do, like any woodpecker does without thinking, your human brain starts
going, and you get to wondering what exactly it is that nature would have you do---and by the time you
wonder that, it’s too late to just *know*. Consciousness is neat and I’m quite happy to have it, but
sometimes knowing a lot of things really gets in the way of knowing *one* thing. And so, a religion:
a collection of the best wisdom from hundreds of years of people, from their most vivid moments of
watching the ten thousand things, often with the acuity of Hafiz or Buddha, and it’s all there for you
to fall back on at those times when you haven’t had your morning coffee yet and teasing out the correct
decision from a whole universe of causes and effects just feels a little beyond you. It seemed, I had to
admit, like something I could get into.

At the same time, it didn’t escape me that the religions I’d taken a shine to so far were exactly the
ones that many people would insist are in fact only philosophies. On the topic of spirits, the
supernatural---in the incarnations I’d met, these religions were silent. Or to the extent that they
really *were* religions rather than philosophies, it was because their adherents took their wisdom to
have bearing on dealings from another plane of existence besides the old physical world: if not a plane
inhabited by legions of spirits, then at least one where there dwelt an emergent human “soul”, not
definable or predictable just in terms of brain firings, its own thing that possibly even had priority
over the physical body and mind.

And, I noted, those supernatural trappings were absent almost exclusively in the Euro-American sphere’s
secularized, watered-down versions of these religions. In their native homes, Buddhism and Taoism can be
found with pantheons of spirits just as surely as Hinduism and Shinto can. The Dalai Lama talks
matter-of-factly about the possibility that he’ll choose to reincarnate in India instead of Tibet next
lifetime around. So though every religion has its body of moral lore, it always seems to come
accompanied by its strange bedfellows: spirits, souls, gods. These are the entities we usually figure
are the real core of any religion. And yet they must be some kind of mistake.

But I couldn’t seem to find any satisfying morality that didn’t bring in at least a little of the
supernatural. The devising of such a thing had been attempted, certainly. Social Darwinism, for example,
much loved in the Gilded Age by rich sociopaths who liked its justification of both their richness
(survival) and their sociopathy (being the fittest). Or today’s secular humanism, which pays as little
regard to non-humans as the name suggests, in its breakneck quest for a middle-class lifestyle for
everyone on Earth---and by so doing manages to eat itself by implicitly sanctioning the environmental
destruction necessary to that goal, thus also the destruction of the very humans it professes to help,
because they had the inadvisable habit of depending on functioning ecosystems to live. Even the better
ones---the *Tao*’s philosophy, secular Buddhism---seemed more helpful the more you started embracing
their metaphysical aspects. Buddhism can be just about training your brain, but it becomes much more
compelling if you take its views on reincarnation to heart. Mark Nunberg, a Buddhist teacher (on
a meditation retreat that I was eventually persuaded to go on), spoke about reincarnation to me and
a group of twenty-odd Twin Cities liberals, and closed his thoughts on the matter with the reflection
that it doesn’t matter so much whether it’s *actually* true, so long as you get some benefit out of
*behaving* as though it were true. If your belief system encourages people to at least *imagine* they
believe a certain thing about the hereafter, I’d say it’s begun crossing the line from philosophical to
spiritual in nature.

Which is not to say (I hasten to add) that involving one or more divine powers automatically makes any
moral system a good one. Far from it. I don’t think we have to catalog the ways in which Christianity,
for instance, which rather makes a point of being more spiritual than rational-philosophical, has been
used as the reason to exile, enslave, or kill not just individuals but entire continents full of people.
In this country, Christianity is the religion you’ll most often hear talked about in that
respect---since it’s “our own” religion and we feel more comfortable criticizing it---but elsewhere
Islam is plenty well-known to be an excuse for enormities against women in Saudi Arabia and holy wars
far and wide, and even Hinduism comes dragging its own baggage of *sati* (widow-burning) and at least
countenancing the development of the caste system. Tim Minchin fields Buddhism:

---alluding to the traditional serfdom there before China took over, in which monasteries (and other
parties, like aristocrats) could require a family to send them one laborer per day year-round.[^mg] In
fact, finding human societies with what I would call a really commendable set of ethics, at least in the
contemporary world, is a tall order, whether their ethical code involves anything supernatural or not.

But I did, I reckoned, have some justificaton in considering small, close-to-the-land, tribal
communities to be at least somewhat better than other human arrangements. Of course when we consider
ecology a part of ethics, as we must, these cultures had sterling records; they had in most cases
coexisted with their landbases for thousands of years, sometimes tens of thousands (in the case of the
southern African Bushmen cultures or the Australian Aborigines), without degrading it, a track record
not claimable by Europeans or middle-Easterners, to say nothing of Euro-Americans. Socially, too, they
had enough respect for egalitarianism and democratic decisionmaking that the framers of the U.S.
constitution took inspiration from the Iroquois Federation’s success,[^rl1] and their quality of life
was high enough that not only escaped slaves but a large number of chafing white colonists’ children
escaped early American towns to go live with the Natives. Those escapees, even white ones, had to be
tied up to be returned to the settler towns, while Indians brought to live among whites always left at
their first opportunity.[^rl2] 

And these cultures I looked up to, one and all, had an understanding that the physical world was not all
there is---that there were *spirits* everywhere. I had come far enough to accept that very
philosophical, materialistic kinds of religion could be useful, and “useful” was as good a definition of
“true” as I could use for such systems. If religions both worldwide and tribal all seemed to find value
in believing the world was inhabited by “spirits”, might it be worth looking further into this matter of
spirits, in case that, too, might have something for me to learn that I hadn’t suspected?
