(Note: I didn’t plan it, but this ended up kind of preposterously long.
But I think it’s probably the last of my big learn-all-about-Korea posts,
so just bear with me and next time I’ll write more adventure stories or
something.)
{: .prefatory}

Let’s talk about Korea’s nationalism. Oh come on. This will be fun.

When I first came here there were some differences that were easy to notice
right away: say, the way you don’t wear shoes inside a school, or the way
that blowing your nose in public is taboo and thought disgusting while,
oppositely, it’s completely normal to loudly hock up loogies and plant
them on the pavement as you walk. But there are other things that I caught on
to a bit slower. Korean nationalism is one of these. It doesn’t always
smack you in the face with obviousness—though sometimes it does—but when you
realize it’s there, you see it everywhere.

There’s probably no better single story to use to talk about
Korea’s nationalism than the Dokdo issue. Dokdo is a disputed island
between Korea and Japan, with a certain amount of Korean population, which I
would like you to try to guess. Japan prefers to call the island Takeshima. I
know the name Takeshima from some brief summary of the issue that I read online
at some point. But I know the name Dokdo because of the cushions at the
_samgyeopsal_ restaurant across the river in town. At most restaurants in town
you sit on the floor with a little square cushion for padding, and the ones at
the _samgyeopsal_ restaurant had a picture of Dokdo on them, with words
around the border saying (for some reason in English), “Dokdo is Korean
Land.” I also know a few other names for Dokdo, because I happen to have
a copy of the second grade language arts textbook from my school, which I used
a little bit to practice my Korean. One of the pieces in it is all about the
names of Dokdo through history, going back to “오래 옛날” (_orae
yennal_, way back when): during the Shilla dynasty (57 BC – AD 935) it was
called Usan-do because a nearby Korean territory called Usan-guk claimed it;
later it was called Sambong-do (Three-Rise Island) because of its shape; and
later it came to be called Doldo (Rock Island), which turned into Dokdo because
of the local accent. (The name Takeshima was not mentioned.) The cover of this
textbook has a picture of Dokdo in the background, with a gigantic Korean flag
rising from the middle, highest rise. A couple weeks ago, I noticed that one of
my students was wearing a shirt that said, “I love Dokdo.” I also
recall that when I went to one of the old royal palaces in Seoul, out in the
city in an unrelated place was a random billboard saying, “Dokdo is
Korean Land.” My students have all done at least one project on the
importance of Dokdo.

Have you guessed the population yet? Here it is. Two people live on Dokdo.
They’re a married couple who fish for octopuses. You can probably
circumnavigate the islands on a boat in about twenty minutes.

That population isn’t exactly correct. Besides the octopus fishers,
there’s also a rotating retinue of forty-some military personnel to
defend Korea’s claim to the territory. Presumably these military people
are also in charge of operating the official Korean post office that has been
built, at great expense, on the island; they also probably run the lighthouse
that was put up there. And someone has to make sure the daily tour boats run
smoothly. And someone also helped during the construction of the
state-of-the-art desalinization plant that was installed there and is capable
of purifying 28 tons of salt water daily.

It all starts to make a little more sense—not enough by a long shot, but a
little more—when you realize that Dokdo is a symbol. Just before World War II,
Korea had been taken over by Japan, and Japan did some things that were in fact
awful. They destroyed Korean culture as thoroughly as they could—they changed
the monuments, they changed the people’s names, they outlawed the Korean
language and made everyone learn Japanese. (To this day, if you’re not Korean,
you can hear Japanese when you talk to old Koreans. They don’t know a word of
English, but they also know that they have to switch languages _somehow_,
because you probably don’t know any Korean. So they switch to the only other
language they know, Japanese. The now-retired principal from my school
described some kind of food to me as “oishii” (Japanese for “delicious”), and
an ancient man I met in the park tried to clarify the meaning of “na” (Korean
for “I, me”) by translating it to “watashi” (same thing in Japanese).) There
were even prisons where they tortured the prisoners, apparently, and the
Koreans miss no opportunity to point this out, as [Sean found
out](http://whereintheworldissean.blogspot.kr/2011/10/you-will-hate-japan-you-will-you-will.html)
(link goes to his blog) when he went with his school on a field trip to one of
these prisons and found an exhibit detailing the methods of torture that were
used.

So Korea has what I suppose are some legitimate reasons to dislike Japan. On
the other hand,[^1] England and France and, well, most of Europe have some
legitimate reasons to hate Germany, but for the most part, as I understand it,
they don’t. Not anymore: they’ve gotten over it. And the people who
committed those atrocities in Germany are mostly dead. Hitler’s ashes
have been completely disintegrated and are nowhere to be found. There are Nazis
still around, but it’s no longer an acceptable thing to be in Germany (or
anywhere really), and Germans these days are far more concerned with making
lots of money and keeping the Euro afloat than they are with killing Jews. But
Korea, by and large, still hates Japan as though the occupation had ended a few
years ago. The old people hate Japan because they will not let go of the
grudge. The young people hate Japan because they’ve been convinced by the
old people that that’s the proper way to think. There are storybooks
about Dokdo in the classrooms where I teach _kindergarten_.

Actually, though, like many things in Korea, this is changing. The young
haven’t completely bought all the propaganda. Kids here watch _Doraemon_ and
_Shin Chan_, and they trade Yu-Gi-Oh! cards. They eat Oishii chips (which are
like Funyuns but mostly air), and some of them even like Hello Kitty, which is
about as Japanese a thing as you can possibly find.  So while there is the
occasional wide-scale anti-Japan school project where they draw [pictures of
Korea vividly defeating
Japan](http://www.geocities.jp/bxninjin2004/data_room/05/cache/01/indexphp.htm)
in various ways, Wikipedia also [assures
us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Japanese_sentiment_in_Korea#Education)
that “A survey found that 60% middle school students and 51% of high school
students in South Korea view the descriptions about Japan and China in the
current Korean history textbooks as biased.”

The nationalism here isn’t just hate against Japan, though. That’s just the
most unsettling facet of it. The more general theme that you see here is a
constant glorification of the many virtues of Korea. There is boundless praise
for anything that’s uniquely Korean. (By the way, in most of this post I’m not
leaving out the “South” in “South Korea” for the usual reason—that it’s
easy—but because South Korea still considers itself one country with North
Korea. Whenever you see a map or an outline of Korea around here, it’s the two
Koreas put together, usually without even a hint of a line at the border. On
one of the country’s two main internet map providers, Naver, you can zoom in to
[Sachangni](http://map.naver.com/?dlevel=11&lat=38.0701537&lng=127.5234399&menu=location&mapMode=0&enc=b64)
and then keep on dragging the map north, and the only intimation that you’ve
dragged past the DMZ is that all the roads suddenly stop.) The same
second-grade textbook I mentioned earlier, for example, has a story about the
big earthenware jars, called _hang’ari_, that they use here to ferment kimchi
and other vegetables. These things are about as exciting as they sound. But
nonetheless the second-graders get to read an absolutely enthralling tale about
a kid who goes with his mother to the _hang’ari_ store. He asks her some
questions about _hang’ari_ and she responds by telling him why _hang’ari_ are
so great: basically, because they let a little bit of wind in and somehow that
helps flavor the food. If they have stories like that just about the jars to
ferment kimchi, it should come as no surprise that kimchi itself has been
subjected to countless nutritional analyses by Korean scientists that all come
to the same conclusion, namely, that kimchi is pretty much the best food in the
world, and prevents the flu, and makes your skin lustrous, and more stuff that
I haven’t had the patience to pay attention to. Sure, the stuff is probably
good for you, since it’s a vegetable and it’s probiotic and there’s usually
fish (anchovy sauce) in it. But it’s not the cure for cancer. Besides kimchi,
pretty much every Korean food is played up as being healthy and “몸에 좋은”
(_mome jo’eun_, good for the body), including of course mountain ginseng (the
best mountain ginseng comes from Korea, remember, and the Chinese and Japanese
stuff is crap), but also anything you get at any restaurant except perhaps the
Western-style ones; it even goes as far as the guy I met a few weeks ago while
he was fishing in the Han River that goes right through the middle of the
megalopolis of Seoul, who told me with a totally straight face that the water
in the Han is not only safe but also makes for fish that are healthy and good
for the body. He was planning to eat some himself and sell the rest.

The Korean alphabet, han’geul, is touted here as the most scientific
alphabet in the world. (As a linguist I can tell you that although
han’geul is well thought out, the International Phonetic Alphabet blows
it out of the water, and if we’re talking about actual languages’
orthographies, Finnish and many others probably beat Korean.) Korean
electronics (Samsung, LG) are universally considered to be the best in the
world, as are Korean cars (Hyundai, Kia). So are Korean celebrities, and
any Korean celebrity who becomes famous internationally becomes a household
name and practically an object of obsession in the country. It’s possible
that you’ve hard of Park Ji-Sung. He’s a soccer player for
Manchester United, and of course he’s Korean. As a result, Manchester
United is the only non-Korean soccer team that’s ever supported in Korea;
quite a few of my students have Manchester United jerseys, and the teacher who
used to come over to do language exchange with me said that one day he’d
like to visit England to see a Manchester United game.

More alarming is the promotion of K-pop and K-dramas. Koreans are under the
impression that these are famous worldwide. They can be forgiven for that,
since it actually is famous in other countries, most of them Asian countries.
But since you’re not from any of those countries, a short introduction.
K-pop is Korean pop music and the most popular stuff is created entirely by
media corporations. Imagine an entire band composed of Korean Hannah Montanas
or Jonas Brothers, except with seven or more people (one of the groups, Big
Bang, is now up to around thirteen), and the only thing most of them actually
do is synchronized dancing. K-dramas are Korean soap operas, usually set in the
times of the old dynasties when all the men had long Fu Manchu beards and
everyone wore elaborate costumes. I’ve only caught brief glimpses of
these in shops where the TV is on, because I put my own TV in storage, but what
I can say is that the acting is every bit as bad as in American soaps; you can
tell even without understanding it. Because these things have caught on in
other countries—many of which, like Cambodia and Laos, probably consume them
because they’re too small and poor to create their own pop
culture—Koreans are happy to talk about the Korean Wave, and may be shocked or
at least a bit put off to find that you have no idea who the main heartthrob in
Big Bang is.

Anyhow, it’s about time I got to some kind of point, so I’m going
to make it this: Why is Korea like this? Why is everything Korean so constantly
praised? The answer, I believe, is that Korea is still an immature country.
It’s only been since World War II that it became a first-world country
(and with absurd speed), so it’s one of the youngest economies in that
club, and it’s still figuring out who it is now that it’s a totally
new country. It seems to me that immature people and immature countries make an
unusually good analogy. Like a middle-school kid, Korea is insecure and
constantly worried about what the other countries think about it. So it puffs
up its own image, oils its hair, puts on some gold jewelry or something. It
ends up looking totally unconvincing to anyone looking at it from outside, but
it’s convinced itself that it’s the coolest kid in school.

It’s anyone’s guess how long Korea will take to finally get
comfortable enough with its position in the world to just be itself. When it
does, people might finally start taking Korea seriously and giving it the
international recognition it so desperately craves right now, though by then
it’ll realize that’s not really what it needed after all. But for
all that, it’s been interesting to see this country during its awkward,
zit-popping phase. And everything happens so fast around here. (Just in the
last few weeks, a new building has been appearing near the main grocery store.
One day there was a concrete foundation, and a couple days later I went down
and saw—surprise!—a three-story frame of thick girders.) So I have no doubt
I’ll be able to watch it grow up. It’s going to be interesting.

[^1]:I got a lot of the ideas in that paragraph and in a few others from a
    conversation I had with some other English teachers from Hwacheon, the next
    town over, when we all went out on Friday night and talked a whole lot about
    nationalism… and other things, since we’re not completely boring
    people, just some of the time.
