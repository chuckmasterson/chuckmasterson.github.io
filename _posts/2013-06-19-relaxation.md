I probably won’t be able to note on Facebook that I’ve written
this, because despite years of promises to the contrary, the phone company or
whoever is in charge of these things has yet to bring high-speed internet out
to my Nana & Papaw’s place in West Virginia to replace the dial-up that
they’re still using ten years after the rest of the world switched.

I spent 2½ days in the woods in Maine, in Camden Hills State Park on top of a
big rock outcropping near a winding up-and-down trail. One of those days I sat
there in the thick carpet of fallen oak leaves and just meditated on how nice
it was to be in the woods with birds chirping incomprehensibly around me. But
what I did more was I went on walks. All barefoot, of course, and as I walked I
constantly looked out for edible plants. I found a fair few, too—bunchberries,
blueberries, raspberries, milkweed, white lettuce, Solomon’s plume, old
acorns. Trouble was, I was such a temporary visitor that I arrived out of the
season of most of them. The bunchberries were barely more thatn swollen flower
buds, and the blueberry flowers must’ve only just dropped off; the
raspberries were still in flower. The white lettuce, meanwhile, had mostly
already gotten too old and bitter. Last fall’s acorns obviously did me no
good. I did enjoy the one Solomon’s plume root I dug up, and I was set to
boil some milkweed stems too, but then I ran out of time. I read a book while I
was there, called *A Small Farm in Maine*, and though I got annoyed by
some of it, I’m glad I persevered to the end, because the author came to
a conclusion that I was coming to too: that familiarity with plants really only
comes from years of living with them and getting to know them through the
seasons. As such a temporary visitor in these woods I couldn’t hope to
learn anything about how to use its plants in a serious way; all I could maybe
get would be a cursory survey of some of the plants that grow there that I
could maybe build relationships with later on. So, put “learning edible
plants” on the long list of things I can’t do ideally until I
settle down. 

You may have detected a certain wistfulness about me in the past few weeks, for
when I eventually do settle down. As much as I love getting around and seeing
new things, I do wish I knew where I’m going to end up, and I’m
really looking forward to calling someplace home. I just don’t want to
make the wrong choice. Of course, I could make myself happy in a lot of places,
but which one would be the best?  Why settle for something that isn’t?
That’s the question that keeps driving me on. And I am getting closer,
bit by bit. Maine impressed me a lot.  It has a strong independent bent to
it, with farmers all over the place providing Maine produce for Maine
residents, who buy the stuff because they like Maine and because it’s
good stuff. A woman working at a coffee shop in Portland gave me a lot of
perspective on this, and explained that for a long time Maine was basically an
island, or the Wild West, and *had* to develop that spirit, or I suppose
become a depopulated ghost state. At the same time, there’s also a lot of
youthful energy and a drive to keep things going, not modernize away all the
good traditions. I met a goat farmer who’s just 31, and thrilled about
her work—she says that after working a few other jobs, now that she’s had
this one land in her lap, she finds that she can finally feel good saying what
she does: “I’m a farmer!”

While I was in Wisconsin at that campsite with the wild food trail, I met a
couple who had also come up for the trail; she was permaculture design
certified, and he thought the issue was interesting but, I think, was less
invested in it and kind of just followed along with her. At any rate, though,
he was the one who had the insight that I thought was most salient: that
permaculture and local farm sorts of things *are* the building blocks of
the new society that needs to emerge, *but* they can’t function as
those building blocks yet, because it’s only the haves who are starting
these, just to prove that they can, and the movement won’t start building
its own momentum until the have-nots start doing permaculture because
it’s a practical way to stay afloat nutritionally and financially in the
real world. Well, the goat farmer I met says she and her peers are headed back
to the land not just because it’s a good thing to do philosophically, but
also because “we’re just too damn poor.” Got a little land?
Turn it into something besides a property-tax suck. With those words she made
Maine look even better to me. Though it’s entirely possible that people
in Wisconsin or Colorado or any other state are also moving back to the land
for the same reason. It’s one more thing for me to gauge.

Sadly, Maine is really far away from everyone I know. For a while I thought of
West Virginia being in the same general sort of region, which I conceived of as
a sort of “the colonies and the states that broke off of them”
region. But of course, the thirteen colonies, though way smaller than the
country we’ve got now, were still a really big place, and span a huge
range of latitudes, and so from Portland, Maine, to Nana & Papaw’s house
is about 12 hours by car, or 2½ days by thumb. (It could’ve been less if
I hadn’t chosen to take the quaintly wooded but unfortunately
deserted US-50.) To Ohio add another several hours. I haven’t decided yet
how heavily to weigh proximity to all my folks in the search for The Right
Place. But however I decide on that, it’s one of the few strikes against
Maine. (Having given Maine such a glowing review, though, I’ll also point
out that its ocean culture is something I don’t feel very connected to at
all, whereas Wisconsin’s lake culture feels homey to me, thanks to all
the formative time I’ve spent at Crowduck and Manito-wish.)

Anyhow, to get to the present, I made it safe and sound to Nana & Papaw’s
as you’ve already deduced, and now I’ve commenced a nice long
period of mentally relaxing. It gets exhausting after a while, all this
planning the next move forward and trying to memorize things about new places.
I’m going to be pretty content over the next three weeks to have other
people in charge of each new thing, and arranging all my transportation for me
with nary a minute spent by an onramp with my thumb in the air. Out here
I’ve gotten a good old feeding for my travel appetite, and we’ve
sat out on the porch watching the sun come down behind the hills and talking
about everything we need to catch up on. And I’ve still got days to relax
in the woods here before anything else really happens. This is me sighing
contentedly: Ahhhhhhh.
