#### I. Introducing *them* 

*(This may be information you already know, if you’ve been using non-binary
pronouns for a while. If you’re not looking for a long read, you might skip
down to section II.)*
{: .prefatory }

Singular *they* has been declared the Word of the Year by the American
Dialect Society. That’s when you use *they* to mean just one person, of
unspecified gender: “If someone shows up, tell them I’ll be back in just a
minute.” Depending on how close a friend you are with *they*, and how
prescriptive you like your grammar, your reaction to that declaration could be
anywhere from “That’s a travesty against English grammar and practically
against all logic!” to “About damn time we had a pronoun that doesn’t force
everyone to decide whether they’re all-or-nothing female <span
class="small-caps"><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">xor</a></span> male!” to
“Whatever, so I guess that means now I can use that instead of ‘he or she’?”

The acceptance of *they* is actually a big deal for a lot of people. The last
ten years or so of gender politics have been very full of progress. Within the
last generation, more or less, our societal attitude (at least in most of the
Global North) toward people who aren’t straight, gender-conforming, “normal”
people has gone from “Those freaks had better keep it in San Francisco and not
try to come near my good American community” to “Fine by me if people get
married to any adult they want; they’re not hurting anyone and they’re just
ordinary people.” Within that context, this last decade or so, people who
*aren’t* straight and/or gender-conforming have felt a quickly growing
courage to explore the huge variety of ways to be human outside those lines.
And a lot of them have found that, when they really take a deep look at their
own gender, the thought of choosing one of the exactly two classic options
feels plain-and-simple wrong. It can feel wrong in a lot of different ways,
probably as many ways as there are people who experience them, or even more—but
in the end it comes down to the same thing: “I don’t feel like a man, and I
don’t feel like a woman. I’m someone else. Myself.”

*(Before I go much further, I should mention that I myself am a cisman, which,
as I heard it excellently explained once, means that when I came out, the
doctors said, ‘It’s a boy!’ and I’ve been pretty fine with that assessment ever
since. Being a cisman means that I’ve never experienced first-hand a lot of the
things I’m going to talk about here. That means, functionally, that I have to
stay somewhere behind the front lines of any cultural shift on gender issues; I
can’t demand, I can only suggest. Those more extreme might say that a cisman
should refrain from trying to say anything about gender, because society’s
heard enough from cismen. I disagree: I may not be the most directly affected
by gender issues, but with a sizeable number of close friends who are on those
front lines, I’m still indirectly affected, which makes me think a lot about
these things, and as long as I’m respectful and avoid trying to dictate
anything or thinking I’m more right than anyone, I believe my thoughts can
matter.)*

Lately this idea, the simple idea that a person can exist outside the
binary, has snowballed through our culture into a critical mass. It’s
following the trajectory that any change in the consciousness of the culture
does, starting as a weird idea on the fringes, and then, because the moment is
right and society is ready for it, going from unheard-of to inevitable.  Every
new idea needs time to percolate out to where everyone knows it, and this one
has only recently come to a boil, but it’s on track to go, in its time, the
same way as LGBT rights, women’s equality, or the theory of evolution.

That’s why the rise of *they* is a story for right now, the Word of
the Year. Once you decide that what your identity feels like is neither male
nor female, it becomes very awkward when someone uses the word *he* or
*she* for you. Imagine, if you will, that you’ve just moved to a new city
and you find that everyone there consistently uses the wrong pronoun when
they’re talking about you.  “This is my new roommate Maria—he just moved here
last month.” Or: “That sandwich is for Jason. She ordered the vegetarian
option.” You would feel adrift, misunderstood, not fully seen, maybe constantly
insulted. And now imagine that there’s not even a pronoun that you can ask
people to use for you, because neither standard option feels better. What could
you do?

A few years ago I remember seeing a fair amount of discussion on alternative
pronouns. Groups that included people who needed a new pronoun started hashing
out brand new ones to use. The ones I remember seeing most were: *ze*, or
variations on it—spelled *xe*, *zie*, or *sie* but generally
pronounced /zee/, and usually declined as
*zir–zirself* or *hir*–*hirself* (/heer/, /heer·self/); and
*e* or *ey*, declined as *em–eir–emself*.

Then, last year, after being away from much discussion on the issue for a
while, I went to a gathering in Colorado where it was high on everyone’s minds,
and discovered that apparently, while I wasn’t looking, a sort of consensus had
been reached.  There were quite a few people there who didn’t identify with
either of the she/he dichotomous options, and those who expressed that in use
of a neutral pronoun nearly all used *they*. And so, over the course of the
week I was there, I got used to using *they* to refer to a single person:
“Where’s Charlie? I wanted to ask them a question.” It’s jarring at first, but
you get more used to it. Later, back at home, first a housemate, then a friend,
then my sweetheart, stepped up to ask their friends for the same thing: Please
use gender-neutral pronouns for me. And I do. It’s a matter, I think, of
respect.  

#### II: The thing is 

But there’s still always been something bugging me about the *de
facto* choice of *they* as the winning gender neutral pronoun.
When I’ve used it for friends, it’s never really felt right to me; it
can feel vaguely like I’m insulting them, even. Now, I know that
*I’m* not the one we’re trying to make comfortable with
gender-neutral pronouns. This new word usage exists for the sake of
people who are gender-neutral themselves, so they can *feel* like
themselves.  But if it doesn’t feel quite right to me, I wonder if
there are other people, people more directly affected, who feel the
same way and haven’t been able to put their fingers on it. On the
chance that there are, I’m going to try to get at the root of it and
point toward something that might work better and feel better. And I’m
going to do it with the help of an imaginary person who’s non-binary
and proud to use *they* pronouns. Let’s see where we can get.

**Q:** *So what’s your issue with* they*? Is it a
grammatical thing—are you one of the people who says that* 
they *is a somehow inherently plural sequence of sounds, and must
never be allowed to bleed over into the singular, or else English will
inevitably collapse into a mishmash of confused muttering and
grunting?*   
**A:** No, I’m well aware that people have been
using *they* in a singular way pretty much since there’s been an
English language. Like Chaucer in the “Pardoner’s Prologue”:

> And whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame,  
> **They** wol come up and offre in Goddes name,   
> And I assoille **hem** by the auctoritee [*hem* is an old form of *them*]   
> Which that by bulle ygraunted was to me. 

Shakespeare, Jane Austen, C.S. Lewis, and plenty other big names
have used it similarly, and English has yet to disintegrate from
that.

But on the other hand, I do have to say that
these writers were almost always using it in a fairly different
situation than your own *they* pronouns. Let me illustrate with
that sentence from earlier: “If someone shows up, tell them I’ll be
back in just a minute.” The two big differences are: (1) This
sentence’s *they* refers to someone of *unknown* gender—could
be male, female, genderqueer, anything, because the person who’s the
antecedent here is completely hypothetical so far. (2) It’s also used
in conjunction with a clearly singular word, *someone*. As soon as you
see the word *someone*, you’re primed for this *them* to be
singular. The first one is emotionally weird to me, and the second one
leads to confusion.

**Q:** *Emotionally weird, and confusing? How so?*   
**A:** The emotional weirdness comes because when I refer to you as *they*, I
have that unknown-gender use in mind, and it feels like I’m saying you have no
knowable gender identity, or I don’t know who you are. There’s another weird
feeling less related to grammar: we also use *they* to talk about huge
faceless entities like the FBI and Monsanto, and sometimes unknown
horrors. *They*’re out to get me. *They*’re coming.  I don’t want to
associate that with my friends.

The confusion is this: when you use *they* on its own, with nothing to
mark it as singular, it gets disorienting. If I say, “They’re going to get here
in about half an hour,” the people who hear me don’t have much to go on to
figure out whether I mean one person or a few. It’s pretty easy to clear it up,
but if you use *they* a lot, you end up doing a lot of clarifying.  

**Q:** *Let’s tackle those one at a time. The first one:
You could get over the emotional weirdness.*   
**A:** You’re right. That one is pretty minor. It’s not a far
leap from “unknown gender” to “non-binary gender”, and I’m already
fairly used to that.  

**Q:** *And we could reclaim* them *from the horror
movie monsters and government agencies.*   
**A:** Hang on with
the word *reclaim*—I’m all for groups reclaiming words that have been
used to oppress them, like *queer* and even *nigga*, but I’ve
got to point out that *they* isn’t really one of those oppressing
words. It’s usually been pretty much as neutral as a word can get.

**Q:** *Well anyhow, let’s move on to the second point, about
being confusing. Isn’t that singular-plural ambiguity the same thing we
have already with* you*, which is singular and plural at the same time?
People don’t get confused about that, and I don’t see anyone trying to
go back to the days of distinguishing* thou *and* ye.
*Eventually, singular* they *would be more understood and people
would get the hang of figuring out the grammatical number from context
given earlier in the conversation.*   
**A:** Well, one minor
point: people *are* distinguishing singular and plural *you* more
and more, lately, with words like *y’all* and *you guys*. But
your point stands, because that’s somewhat recent and English chugged
along for a long time without much use of those. I think
*they* has a little more potential for confusion than *you*,
because it shares more semantic territory: 

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; display: block; margin: 0
auto; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"> <tbody><tr> <td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> I </td>

<td rowspan="2" style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> you
</td>

<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> he </td>

<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> she </td>

<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; border-bottom: 1px solid transparent; padding:
10px;"> they </td>

<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> it </td> </tr>

<tr> <td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> we </td>

<td colspan="4" style="border-top: none; border: 1px solid #abc;
padding: 10px;"> they </td> </tr> </tbody></table>

It has to share with the plural not just of itself but also of all the
other first-person singular pronouns. Clearly, that doesn’t make it impossible
to use. A lot of people get by with it day by day.

However, let’s look at what would happen if *they* got carried through to
its logical endpoint and victory: it supplants both *he* and
*she* (and who knows, maybe *it* too), so that it’s the only third-person
singular pronoun for people, like the Hungarian word *ő*, which subsumes
our *he* and *she*. Then we could live in a world inhabited not by
*men* and *women* but by just *people*, and you wouldn’t have to make
any assumptions about someone from what they look like and how they dress, and
you wouldn’t have to ask anyone their pronouns because we’d use the same ones
for everyone. I know some people who already use *they* like this, not
quite to the exclusion of *he* and *she*, but at least as a frequent
replacement. If it took over completely, then the chart above would look like
this: 

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; display: block; margin: 0 auto;
text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;"> <tbody><tr> <td style="border: 1px
solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> I </td>

<td rowspan="2" style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> you </td>

<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; border-bottom: 1px solid transparent; padding: 10px;">
they </td>

<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> it </td> </tr>

<tr> <td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;"> we </td>

<td colspan="2" style="border: 1px solid #abc; border-top: 1px solid transparent; padding:
10px;"> they </td> </tr> </tbody></table>

Or maybe even:

<table style="border-collapse: collapse; display: block; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; vertical-align: middle;">
<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;">
I
</td>
<td rowspan="2" style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;">
you
</td>
<td rowspan="2" style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;">
they
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid #abc; padding: 10px;">
we
</td>
</tr>
</table>

I can’t actually guarantee it, but I have a gut feeling that *they* in this
situation would be way more confusing than *you* is now. Now, of
course, languages are organic systems, and if English’s pronoun system got too
confusing for its speakers, a new pronoun would evolve to fill the gap. But I
don’t think we’d get that far. I think *they* would get stalled on the way
to this egalitarian future by a resistance on the part of English speakers to
use it in so many situations, and it would be permanently relegated to a
minority usage, with much less potential to erase boundaries.  

**Q:** *Alright, interesting theory. But we both know that trying
to foretell the future of anything as complicated as humans and language is a
recipe for embarrassment. Forty years ago no one could have predicted that*
they *would be getting used the way it is now; they’d probably call it an
insane idea—and yet, here we are. If we stick to the present, it sounds like
you have a lot of minor quibbles that don’t add up to a reason to change
anything.*    
**A:** Fair point. Well, maybe none of them on their own are major
issues. But taken together, they make *they* feel like a second-class
pronoun. And I think that’s what my reluctance about it boils down to:
**Using *they* feels like a compromise,** like settling
for what the English-speaking community is willing to kick down to you. It
feels like you demanded, “We need a pronoun that shows us respect!” and the
English language said, “Well ... we’ve got this pronoun that we use
already for something *kinda* like what you’re talking about. ...
Tell you what, you can have that—and you’d better like it, because that’s
as far as we’re willing to go.” Both the mainstream genders get their own
pronoun, but you have to share yours with other concepts, and just put up
with all the ambiguity. 

**Q:** *So what do you propose?*   
**A:** I think something along the lines of the *ze* or *ey* pronouns
I mentioned earlier would do the job with more dignity.  

**Q:** *We tried that.*   
**A:** And it didn’t fail.
People are still using those new pronouns in big sections of the
genderqueer community. When I was in Colorado at the gathering I mentioned,
some people introduced themselves with, “My name is My-Name-Here, and I use
*ze–zir–zey* or *they–them–their* pronouns.” I’ve heard similar things in a
few places.  

**Q:** *Yeah, but* they *is much more widely used than any
of those.*   
**A:** There doesn’t have to be just one winner
that takes all. Unmaking the global patriarchal hegemony, which is a goal
that I have to guess you’re on board with, is going to involve a lot of
re-localizing and strengthening small communities; local networks of
friends are the most effective (and probably the only) way to create
alternatives to the top-down, centralized kind of culture we get from mass
media and marketing. Each pocket of people can have its own norms and its
own ways of speaking, and when they get together, they can work things out
between them; we’ll end up with a patchwork of different places with
different words, the same way that the word for *crawdad* or
*soda-pop* seems to change every few states already.  That’s
dissensus, and it’s how dialects—and diversity in general—arise.

**Q:** *So you’re in favor of people not just defaulting to*
they*, but giving* ze *another shot instead?*   
**A:** Sure, although I want to toss in something here that’s
decidedly an opinion. I personally don’t like the words *ze* or
*ey*.

In the case of *ey* (or *e*) it’s because
it’s awkward and too close to words that already exist. I believe a really
good pronoun to fill this gap should be easy to tell apart in speech from
*he*, *she*, and *they*.  I’ve tried using *e* in real life and the
first thing I noticed is that we hardly ever say *he* and *him* when
we actually talk—we say *’e* and *’im*, and also *’em* for
*them*. The forms of *e/ey* sound like *he* or *them* and
that’s no good, because we want something that’s unequivocally different.

For *ze*, I just don’t think it feels enough like an English word. It
originated in German with *sie*, and the addition of a sci-fi-esque
*z* didn’t help it any. Its declension *hir* is the most awkward of
all the widespread gender-neutral words, because it looks like it should just
be pronounced /her/, and the approved pronunciation /heer/ can’t be casually
slurred like pronouns always are in real conversations.  *Zir* (/zer/) is
a vast improvement but still feels like it’s from a ’70s sci-fi novel.

**Q:** *So what pronoun* do *you like?*   
**A:** Someone named “Shino”, the basically anonymous author of
the <a href="https://genderneutralpronoun.wordpress.com/"
target="_blank">Gender Neutral Pronoun Blog</a> (which has exactly one
post), has collected some good information on shots people have taken at
creating a new one, including a link to <a
href="http://www.english.illinois.edu/-people-/faculty/debaron/essays/epicene.htm"
target="_blank">this long digest</a> of calls for a gender-neutral pronoun
dating back to the early 1800s. A lot have been proposed, like
*thon* (/<strike>th</strike>ən/, contracted from *that one*),
*co–cos–coself* (created and still used in the intentional community
Twin Oaks, in Virginia), and a 1912 schoolteacher’s awkward
*he’er*. Shino singles out a few good ones to rate and comment on. I
like the one that comes out on top, *ne–nem–nir–nemself*, for most of the
same reasons Shino does—see the post for more, but: It’s reasonably
distinct from the existing pronouns; it sounds pretty close to halfway
between them instead of listing toward one or the other; it sounds singular
(by virtue of sounding like the other singular pronouns); it uses some of
the most common sounds in the English language, which makes it sound
natural; and as a bonus the *n* can evoke the word *neutral*. (If it
sounds goofy to you, keep in mind that practically any unfamiliar pronoun
would, because pronouns are so deeply ingrained into our mental language
pathways that it’s very noticeable when something seems askew. And anyway,
try saying *her* over and over with a straight face.) This is one that
I’d like to try, and I’ll probably use it on this blog if and when a
situation arises.

**Q:** *And you think that might catch on?*   
**A:** It’s worth a try. Any new pronoun is going to face a huge
uphill battle, because pronouns are what linguists call a *closed lexical
class*, a set of words that’s small, very conservative to change, and very
hard to add to. That’s why *they* has gotten popular—it’s already in
that exclusive club, so the battle there is won, but only via the path of
least resistance (which, I should make sure to point out, still involved a
lot of resistance). New pronouns *have* caught on before (if in a
limited scope), like the ones I mentioned in the last answer, so it’s
obviously not an impossibility. It just requires hard work and persistence.
But I believe it’s worth it.

But: since I’m cisgender, I’m not going to be asking people to use *ne* or
any of the others for myself, and I’m not going to try to impose a specific one
on anyone who does use non-binary pronouns. All I can really ethically do is
bring up the issue and suggest that we take another look at some of the
possibilities we’ve sort of abandoned. And that’s what I’ve done here.

I’m well aware that this is a contentious issue and that pronouns are
an intensely personal matter for a lot of people.  I’ve tried hard not to
set myself up as the Pronoun Authority here, and not to impose my ideas on
people who have a much greater stake in this than I do.

And I’m really curious to know what you think about all this stuff I just said.
I have a few specific questions: 

* Have you used *they* as a non-binary pronoun like this? To what extent?
* Does it make you uneasy in any of the ways I mentioned it does for me (or in
  any other ways)?
* If it does, does it seem like a different neutral pronoun would be any better
  on those accounts?
* If you couldn’t use *they* (or *he* or *she*), what pronoun would you use?
* Should I mind my own cisgendered business? 

I’m really interested in the comments on this. If you’ve never been to this
blog before, there’s a comment form below that you can use without signing up
for anything or even leaving a name. (The comments are delayed in publishing
because they have to get approved manually by me, but that’s only for technical
reasons, and I publish everything that isn’t automated spam.)  

I’ve said my bit for now—let’s talk.
