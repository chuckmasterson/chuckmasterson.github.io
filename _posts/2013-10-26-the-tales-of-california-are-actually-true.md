Yes, I will someday write about Seattle, Portland, and Eugene. But it may have
to wait awhile. The last month or so of my trip is looking like it might not
involve many computers until the last few days.

For the moment, I’m in Berkeley. Up until extremely recently -- in
fact, even for a while after I’d entered it -- California was not
part of my mental construct of the world.  I think this is because of the
hippies, and a few other things. I knew that there was a California, but I
thought of it more as a place that happened in the ’60s and ’70s.
After that, California was expended, like a firecracker, and ceased to exist.
By the time I was born, California was long gone, and when I got started
traveling, only rumors of it still persisted.  There were intimations that
something besides hippies was still happening in what was allegedly a
still-existing California, but these fancies could be easily dismissed. The
popular cultural image of the San Francisco streetcars was actually just
advertising dreamt up by the Rice-a-Roni company. California wine is really
imported from France by a company called California Importing, LLC. The
Hollywood legend is easily the most persistent and widely perpetuated
California-believers’ story, but a moment’s reflection is enough
for anyone to realize that no place so horrible could actually exist; people
would have burned it down decades ago. Movies and sordid celebrity gossip are
made in a variety of locations worldwide, mostly at the command of Rupert
Murdoch.

So imagine my surprise when I rolled into the Bay Area and found it to be every
bit as tangible as Billings, Montana, or Willmar, Minnesota. My weird mental
block against California also explains why, for a long time, I had no idea
where any Californian cities were in relation to each other. As it turns out,
it’s pretty simple: Northern California, where the temperatures are
humane in summer and October actually means something climatically, is just
full of a bunch of small towns where people grow lots and lots of weed. Three
hundred miles or so down the coast you get the Bay Area, where the following
cities are conveniently bunched together in a gigantic snarl of seething
humanity and asphalt that surrounds a big old bay: San Francisco, Oakland, San
Jose, and Berkeley. Then there’s a lot more nothing until you’re
almost to Mexico, where you get Los Angeles, and shortly after that you get San
Diego, and after that you’re in Tijuana and God save you then. Oh, and
Sacramento is inland from the Bay Area, and since it’s not on the coast
it’s almost like it’s not even in California, because everyone
knows the point of California is its coast. It could equally well be shaped
like Chile. Actually, looking at Google Maps just now I’ve discovered
that once you cross the mountains it isn’t in fact all godforsaken
desert, so there’s another surprise for me, but Death Valley is still
real, in fact realer than it should be.

I’ve had a brief but concentrated stay in the Bay Area, one that
will end tomorrow morning. Awesome things started even before I got there.
I was in Ukiah, a hundred miles north of the Bay, and getting very
frustrated because it was taking longer to get a ride than anywhere else
ever had except for Lima, Ohio. After four hours, though, someone did
stop, and it was a guy and his son and they were going all the way to the
city. During a stop-off for an errand at a sporting goods store, I asked,
“He your son?”

“Yep. I’m taking him to the airport to go back to
college.”

“Which college does he go to?”

“He’s out in Iowa.”

“No shit! Which college?”

“Grinnell?” he said, using the inflection that every
Grinnell-involved person uses to probe whether the person they’re talking
to is one of the few who have ever heard of it in their entire life.

So needless to say the ride got more interesting from there. His son is named
Nick and he’s named Cosmo. Nick is a first-year (only halfway through his
first semester) and is on the basketball team. I told him about all the
buildings he can climb and the abandoned areas he can explore, doing my part to
keep all new Grinnellians in a good supply of trouble. (I did this in April
with Cherylyn and she proved to be an excellent vector: she’s been
recruiting more people to be mischievous with her, and so the invasion
spreads.) Even better, it turned out to be Nick’s birthday, so everyone
got cupcakes baked by some family friends of theirs.

My days actually in the Bay Area have been packed with seeing stuff and doing
stuff. I saw the streetcars and the insanely pitched hills and the Crookedest
Street in the World and the Golden Gate Bridge and Ghirardelli Square and the
vast Chinatown and Japantown and the Castro (which was plastered with posters
for gay-themed concerts and Halloween parties and such). I bought really good
tea and a pair of socks and some kkaennip seeds (at a Japanese gardening store;
the Japanese call it *shiso*), and I talked a lot and very stimulatingly about
permaculture and community with the people I’m staying with, who have a
cooperative house centered around community-building and nonviolence.  And I
met two awesome girls who are also traveling the country, but they have a car,
and I unlocked a new hitchhiking achievement by catching a ride with them
without standing by the road, without going to the road, and without even
planning how to get to the road. Since the Bay Area is such a flustercluck of
highways, this is a welcome development, as is the fact that I’ll get to spend
a whole day with them driving [California

sharing travel stories and all that. 

In short, I’m glad the Bay Area is a real place, and that I came to it.
