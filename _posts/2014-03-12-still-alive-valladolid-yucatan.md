This one is going to be actually just a quick one to let you know I’m
still alive, like the original intention of these Still Alive posts was, before
I started making them longer and longer. I’m in Valladolid, a very nice
little city, planning to head to a cenote tonight and camp out before enjoying
it tomorrow. After that I’ll possibly visit Chichén Itzá, and then
I’ll probably start heading back. I was planning to wait until a few days
from now, but as I consider it, a budget of ten days to make it from the
Yucatán to Cincinnati looks pretty paltry, and having a few days of cushion
will probably serve me well. I found a place that offers free (!) internet
here, something basically unheard-of in Mexico, so I’m using it to my
full advantage. But at some point I should really get going.
