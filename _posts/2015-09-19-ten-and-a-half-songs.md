Well, the wild rice thing didn’t pan out, because the guy who was going to take
me was too busy building a workshed. But to make up for not having any pictures
of what it looks like to go ricing, I’ve got another random little thing.

My cousin Katie keeps a [blog](http://www.alwayskatie.com/) (and may in fact be
the only other person I know who’s still using a trusty old Blogspot blog even
though the technology behind it is an unholy sixteen-year-old mess of
unmodernizable code), and has somewhere stumbled upon the “Blogtember
Challenge”, put on by another blogger named Bailey: Bailey posts a prompt for
each day of September, and people who are doing the challenge respond to it,
and there you go, a month full of blog posts. But I’m really only interested in
one, because I thought it sounded fun: 

> “Put your iTunes/music player on shuffle and share the first 10 songs that
> play.”

It turns out that I have a lot of music I haven’t gotten around to
listening to yet, so I decided it’d make more sense to share the first ten
songs I actually recognize, whether or not they’re embarrassing.

##### Number One

**The Mariner’s Revenge Song**    
The Decemberists, from *Picaresque*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t0CR1IJKMPo" %}

Well, we’re off to a good start: an 8½-minute long ballad of revenge on the
high seas in the olden days, told with Colin Meloy’s classic slightly overblown
but incredibly satisfying lyrics.

##### Number Two

**Suo** (or **Marshland**)  
Loituma, from *Things of Beauty*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a-zYmBVP3Lc" %}

From the same people who brought you the infamous “[Ieva’s
Polka](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4om1rQKPijI)” that I memorized during the
hours I was bored in freshman high school biology, it’s a much calmer, more
mysterious, even ominous song.

##### Number Three

**Fortune Plango Vulnera**  
Carl Orff, from *Carmina Burana*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Nn3PcESF7w" %}

Whether or not you know it, you’ve heard the first song in this opera, “[O
Fortuna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNWpZ-Y_KvU)”. What you might not know
is that it’s only one of twenty-five straight songs that all kick nearly as
much ass. If you’ve never listened to the whole opera, do it; it will make your
life permanently and measurably better.

##### Number Four

**Cuba**  
Isaac Albéniz, from *Suite española*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZTaGbaUjILY" %}

I don’t know nearly as much about this one as the others. Someone gave me the
entire *Suite española* once, and I’ve listened to it occasionally since
then, and I like it. That’s all I’ve got for you.

##### Number Five

**cock/ver10**  
Aphex Twin, from *drukqs*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-M8sIzLNVT0" %}

I’ve only just listened to my first bit of Aphex Twin. It’s disorienting,
chaotic stuff, and thus I love it. I also really appreciate that every song on
this album is named with Welsh-esque semi-nonsense. Others include: “jynweythek
ylow”, “kladfvgbung micshk”, “54 cymru beats”, “prep gwarlek 36”, and “hy a
scullyas lyf adhagrow”.

##### Number Six

**Even the Good Wood Gone**  
Why?, from *Eskimo Snow*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDgpZKgok3Y" %}

Not a lot of bands would think of writing a song told from the viewpoint of a
mummified pharaoh. Why? has some of my favorite lyrics ever, and their
alliteration and assonance is awesome, like in “[The Fall of Mr.
Fifths](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zx_BfRa3Vko)”:

> […] this Christmas, is this twisted?  
> Why be upset?  
> I never said I didn’t have syphilis, Miss Listless  
> Hard like the bricks that I pound my fists with  
> I mean she’s hard like the bricks that I pound with my fists.

##### Number Seven

**Variation No. 23**  
Rachmaninoff, from *Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini* 

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HvKTPDg0IW0"
caption="(at 21:40)" %}

You can’t really separate this variation from the other 23 that make up the
rhapsody, but that’s how it is in the recording I have. I don’t know much about
Rachmaninoff in general, but one fun fact is this: Eric Carmen based “[All by
Myself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3j_fdSpkmE)” heavily on Rachmaninoff’s
*<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEGOihjqO9w">Piano Concerto No.
2</a>* (especially the second movement, starting 11:23). He thought it was in
the public domain, but after he released it he got a call from the estate of
Rachmaninoff, and had to pay up big-time.

##### Number Seven and a Half

**In This Temple, As in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth**  
Sufjan Stevens, from *Illinois*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XbfzeUmkECE" %}

A 35-second transition song can hardly count as a whole song, even if it comes
from a seriously fun album.

##### Number Eight

**Drinking Song of a Germinating Seed**  
Jayber Crow, from *Two Short Stories*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIlAndziMq4" %}

These two guys came to play a little show at my college in a little town in
Iowa, and if they hadn’t, I would never have heard of them. They belonged in a
little town in Iowa more than any other band I saw there. They sing songs about
the Midwest—the farms struggling to find a new generation of farmers, the Rust
Belt cities, the forests and fields—and a lot of their songs are like nature
itself pointing out little moments.

##### Number Nine

**Orange Sky**  
Alexi Murdoch, from *Time without Consequence*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HjHvJE1XU7E" %}

I never took that much of a shine to this one, for no really good reason. I
think it’s just too clean and smooth for me.

##### Number Ten (and the last)

**Color in Your Cheeks**  
The Mountain Goats, from *All Hail West Texas*

{% include video.html src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zmW7ejFYX_8" %}

Yes! The Mountain Goats made it onto the list! John Darnielle looks like a
respectable, normal, middle-aged guy, but he has some stories that you don’t
tell to children. He’s been addicted to meth, worked in a psychiatric hospital,
and had an abusive stepfather, and he came out the other end of all that
writing songs with the most consistently intense lyrics of any songwriter I
know of. This one doesn’t get deep into hard life, but in a flophouse like the
one he’s telling about, those realms are never far off, and you can tell. I
recommend the Mountain Goats unequivocally.

* * *

So there you go. They actually turned out to be mostly awesome, and in fact
they’re a pretty good representation of the kinds of stuff I like to listen to.
So I hope you listen to them, and maybe even like them. I don’t have a
concluding thought here except that I just think that would be swell.
