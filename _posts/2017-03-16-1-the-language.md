If you read this blog to find out what’s going on in my life, for a while I haven’t really been
giving you much to go on. A lot of opinions, and that’s pretty much it. I kinda like my opinions
(that’s why I believe them), but even I get tired of reading nothing else here. It’s much more fun
when I can tell a story, and maybe some opinions happen to be part of the story. That
way *you* find out what the heck I’m up to these days, and *I* know that I took some belief I had
and lived it. So I’m going to try to do more of that. Starting right now:

* * *

So what’s all this about “sugarbush”? How did I end up at a traditional Ojibwe maple syrup camp?
What did I do there?

It’s kind of a long story, but it winds through several things I’ve been wanting to write about
anyhow, so I’ll tell it all (in three parts, because it got long). It starts before I ever got to
Minneapolis, and before I had any idea it was starting.

I might not have been able to articulate it at the time, but when I started my [Year of
Adventure](/wayfinding#topic-year-of-adventure), one of the reasons I put my thumb out that first
day was that I needed to search for someplace to be from.

I felt, and still feel, that I had grown up nowhere. I had a childhood, sure, but it mostly took
place in a suburb and, like most suburbs, mine was purposely set up to give the impression that it
was no place in particular. Ohio has qualities, I suppose. But I wouldn’t know. I grew up insulated
from them because of suburb developers who came and went long before my time and left behind
neighborhoods designed to be blank slates. I didn’t feel like I was *from* Ohio---and I still
don’t---because if you live on a blank slate, there’s nowhere to be *from*.

What applies to suburbs applies, I believe, also to the United States in general. In the three
hundred years or so since the American project got earnestly underway, one of the most consistent
themes has been the attempt to erase all memories and remnants of the past and create something new
under the sun, a country built not on top of a complex history stretching into time immemorial but,
instead, a shining new republic drawn on a clean sheet of paper. As if there could ever be such
a thing as a place with no history.

We can believe there is, though---even if we got good grades in history---because, although we’re
aware of the past, we don’t think of it as something we’re part of. We think of it as interesting
background information. There used to be Indians here. Isn’t that a quaint notion? To think, this
land that’s now ours was once populated by people who were, well, not us! How anxiously they must
have been waiting for us to get here and turn the land into what it is now. It was nice of them to
hold down the fort for us. Or, alternatively: What a travesty that they’re all gone now. How do we
live our lives well now that there are none (0) of them to live good lives here?

The sense of placelessness that comes from that way of thinking is how I knew that, when I found
a place to be from, part of becoming local to that place was going to have to be getting up to speed
on the real history, the deep history, of the place. The pre-American, pre-Columbian history.

Languages have a way of teaching you history without you even knowing it. Even though you live in
a thoroughly modern world, even if you never took a course in early English literature, you have
some dim understanding of what life was like in previous centuries in Europe, because you’ve been
surrounded, since you started speaking the language, in thoughts that come to us from those days. We
don’t put the cart before the horse; we don’t burn our candle at both ends; we sometimes have a hard
row to hoe. You know the inhabitants of the “theosystem”[^1] of those times---the spirits large and
small, from fairies to wizards to princesses to giants, who inhabited the imaginations and lives of
the Britons---because of the fairy tales that (if you learned English in the cradle) you heard when
you were so young that they became foundational parts of your self.

[^1]: It’s like an ecosystem, but for the spirits local to a place.

And, it so happens, languages are something I’m good at. So as I was looking for someplace to be
from, I realized that an important step in the process of becoming part of the place would have to
be learning the language that belonged to that place. I would learn, and I would get to know some
new spirits. And unlike the spirits I grew up with, they wouldn’t feel like they belonged to
a distant, semi-mythical time and place, removed from me by an ocean and a few hundred years.
I would (I hoped) learn new common sense and new spirits, and knowing them would make my new
homeland feel more immediate and alive to me.

That’s the full answer to the question I’ve often been asked and often answered less than
satisfyingly, the question of why I’m learning Ojibwe. It seems that I belong to the northern
forests and the lakes. I should learn the language they understand, so I can understand them.

### What’s Ojibwe? What’s it like?

Ojibwe, Ojibwa, Chippewa, and Anishinaabe are all different names for the same group of people.
*Anishinaabe* is how I usually hear the people named when someone’s speaking the language, but
the same person might use *Ojibwe* when they’re speaking English, or might still use *Anishinaabe*.
It’s only a little confusing.

You might see *Anishinaabeg* sometimes, which is just the plural. A couple other words to be aware
of are *Ojibwemowin* and *Anishinaabemowin*{% include ogg src="anishinaabemowin" %}. The
*-mowin* suffix means you’re talking specifically
about the language (and not just about the people or the culture), is all.

The Anishinaabe nation is a large one, and northern. The language has been spoken around fires from
what’s now known as North Dakota, on through Minnesota and Wisconsin, up into all the watery parts
of Manitoba and Ontario (and on north until it blends into Oji-Cree and finally into Cree, a cousin
language), and around the top and bottom of Lake Superior, fading into related Algonquian languages
in the east, like Odaawaa near Ottawa, Mi’kmaq in Québec, Passamaquoddy in Maine, and the ghost of
Lenape in New York State. The Anishinaabe people themselves once lived on the salty shores of the
Atlantic. That was many centuries ago. They found their current home, and became the Anishinaabe, by
following a prophecy and a miigis shell in the stars to the land here where food grows on the
water---that’s manoomin, what you may know as wild rice.

You already speak some Ojibwe, believe it or not. Ever heard of a moose? English grabbed that word
straight from Ojibwe---*moonz*.{% include ogg src="moonz" %} And a moccasin, too: it started out as *makizin*.{% include ogg
src="makizin" %} *Chipmunk* is how
settlers garbled the word *ajidamoo*{% include ogg src="ajidamoo" %} (which actually means ‘squirrel’). Somehow our word *pecan*
made it to English from Ojibwe *bagaan*, though you won’t find pecans growing in Ontario. (It means ‘nut’ here.)

And then there are all the place names. Mississippi (*Misi-ziibi* {% include ogg src="misi-ziibi" %}, ‘big river’), Milwaukee
(*Mino-aki*, ‘good land’), Chicago (*Zhigaagong*,{% include ogg src="zhigaagong" %} ‘at the skunk place’, which seems somehow
fitting), Manitoba (*Manidoo-baa*, ‘spirit straits’), Menominee (*Manoominii*, ‘wild rice people’),
Michigan (*Mishi-gamaa*, ‘it’s a big body of water’), and small towns, counties, and rivers all
around Anishinaabewaki (Anishinaabe country).

Ojibwe is part of the Algonquian family of languages. Languages from the same family are the sources
of the long, complicated, yet compellingly rhythmic place names you’ll find in New England, like
Narragansett, Massachusetts, Piscataqua, Passadumkeag,{% include ogg src="passadumkeag" %} Squannacook, Pemigewasset, Winnipesaukee, and
Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.{% include ogg
src="chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg" %}

Keeping the same spirit, Ojibwe is not a language known for its brevity. Beginning to learn the
language requires a definite mental adjustment.

There are some notions that can be expressed with simple, short words. A lot of animals’ names, for
example, are friendly and bite-size, like *makwa* ‘bear’, *migizi* ‘bald eagle’, *nigig* ‘otter’,
*adik* ‘reindeer’, and *amik* ‘beaver’ (and not including *mashkode-bizhiki* ‘buffalo’ and
*ogiishkimanisii*{% include ogg src="ogiishkimanisii" %} ‘kingfisher’).

Saying much about those animals, though, will mean that sooner rather than later, you’re going to
have to use a verb. Most of Ojibwe is verbs. A sentence that English would express with several
words might correspond to an Ojibwe sentence consisting of a single verb. For example, to say “I’ll
try to speak Ojibwe with her”, you’d use a single word: *Inga-gagwe-anishinaabemotawaa.* {% include
ogg src="inga-gagwe-anishinaabemotawaa" %} All our
words are in there somewhere:

In- | ga- | gagwe- | anishinaabe
I   | will| try to | Anishinaabe
{: .gloss }

-mo                | -taw       | -aa
speak the language | to someone | to him/her
{: .gloss }

It’s just that they’re all stuck together and you have to figure out what goes where before you
start talking, or talk slow.

Sometimes, like in that last example, all the little bits seem, to an English-speaking mind,
sensible and there for a reason. But other times, it seems like a word is far longer than it has any
reasonable need to be. Like, for example, the Ojibwe word for Red Lake (a big lake and big center of
Anishinaabe culture in Northern Minnesota): *Miskwaagamiiwi-zaaga’iganiing*,{% include ogg
src="miskwaagamiiwi-zaaga'iganiing" %} which for all that essentially just means “At the red lake”:

Miskwaa- | gami-                | (i)wi- | zaaga’igan | -iing
Red      | like a body of water | it is  | lake       | at
{: .gloss }

But hidden in all those syllables is one of my favorite things about Anishinaabemowin. Each word is
built up, piece by piece, of little elements of thought, and you can mix them together in almost
infinitely creative ways, once you get the hang of it. It is a language made of liquid, and nearly
every word is a vivid picture.

Let me explain a little. I’m comparing Anishinaabemowin, here, to English. The vocabulary of English
is a huge collection of words that each stand for some fully-formed concept. One word, one concept.
You can’t really alter the word to get something different, beyond maybe gluing it onto
another word.

Also, a lot of these English words are nouns: *things*. English has a pronounced tendency toward
reification. Look at that last sentence. We say that English *has* a tendency, it has
this thing called a *tendency*. Have you ever seen a tendency? Me neither. But we still agree that
it’s a thing you can possess. And there’s another thing-word, *reification*, to mean ‘turning an
intangible into a thing’. That’s an action if I ever acted, but we make it a thing. Not to mention
that if you don’t know what *reification* is, and if you don’t know, at a minimum, the word *reify*,
you’re kind of out of luck, unless somehow you can see the Latin word *res*, ‘thing’, in there. 

We don’t think too much about how often we reify, but it’s right there in our everyday language:
think of it the next time someone asks you incredulously, “Is that a thing?”

Anishinaabemowin works very differently. Anishinaabemowin, for the most part, doesn’t deal with
*things* that *are* other things or are *had* by other things; it deals with events---or, to not
reify, I should say it deals with what’s happening, to whom and because of what else is happening.

In English there are *teachers*, in Ojibwe there’s who’s teaching (*gekinoo’amaaged*). In English
you might forget someone’s name, in Ojibwe you would forget how they’re named (*gi-wanendaan
ezhinikaazod*). When you look up a noun in an Ojibwe-English dictionary, you’ll often find a verb or
adverb that involves that noun, instead. Want *day*? Well, you can say ‘it’s daytime’ (*giizhigad*)
or ‘all day’ (*gabe-giizhig*) or ‘for two days’ (*niizho-giizhig*). You express the concept of
*weather* through a word that means ‘what’s happening (outside)’. Ojibwe *has* nouns, and many of
them are independent, but plenty of them are built from verbs; the verb came first, and if you find
yourself needing a noun, there’s that too.

And all these words are made out of a bunch of little atoms that you can combine and recombine in
whatever ways you want. There are two interesting results from this. One is that you can achieve
some very subtle shades of meaning by just swapping out one atom for another, or adding another one.
Louise Erdrich wrote in *Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country* that “Shades of feeling can be mixed
like paints.” And:

> a man fell off a motorcycle with a pipe in his mouth and drove the stem of it through the back of
> his head. There can be a verb for anything.

The other result of building from all these little parts is that all the words are powerfully
related, connected to each other, as opposed to English where you have to memorize each one. English
has the words *remember*, *forget*, *think*, *happy*, *excited*, and others to describe some states
of mind. In Anishinaabemowin you have the suffix *-endam* to mean “state of mind”, and it connects all
of these, each one with a sensible prefix to go along with it: *remember* is *mikwendam* from
*mikw-* ‘find’; *forget* is *wanendam* from *wan-* ‘lose’; *think* is *inendam* from *in-* ‘in such
a way’, *happy* is *minwendam* from *mino-* ‘good’, *excited* is *ombendam* from *omb-* ‘up’. You
can sub out the intransitive *-endam* for the transitive *-enim* to make it something you do to
someone: You can forget someone *wanenim*, be excited about someone *ombenim*, and so on. You can
see how easy it is to make words up. I just did it with *ombenim* and I’ve only been learning in my
spare time for less than a year.

I won’t lie: it’s also a tricky language. Verbs come in four main categories, and the most
complicated of them, verbs that describe that something is being done to someone, can be conjugated
in several thousand different ways. The conjugation tells you not just who’s doing it and when, but
also who it’s being done to, how confident the speaker is about all this, what kind of clause you’re
in, and more.


### How I’m learning

In many cities in the Eastern half of the country, it’s understandable if you believe there are no
longer such people as Native Americans, so thoroughly have they been murdered, exiled from their
homes, or assimilated. But in Minneapolis, Native Americans are unmistakably present and defiantly
still Native.

I live no more than a few blocks from Franklin Avenue, where the American Indian Movement started in
the 1960s. Even closer to me is Little Earth, the first housing project in the country built for
Natives. When I walk around the neighborhood I pass places like the Minneapolis American Indian
Center, the Ancient Traders Market, All My Relations Art Gallery (combined with Powwow Grounds
Coffeehouse), the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe building, the Red Lake Embassy, and other places I’m sure
I haven’t noticed. You can’t get more surrounded in Native America without moving to a reservation.

What’s remarkable isn’t that I was able to find language tables to study at, but that it took me so
long to get around to going to them regularly, since I’d decided before I even moved here that
I wanted to learn the language. I wish I’d gotten started as soon as I moved here.

I started studying the language in earnest around this summer. I rode out to Louise Erdrich’s
bookstore, Birchbark Books, and got some textbooks; I found out when language tables met (there are
at least three per week around here); I made flash cards and made a habit of idly flipping through
my Ojibwe--English dictionary to learn new words. I’ve been moving along ever since, sometimes
faster, sometimes slower.

The language tables help the most. Each table meets once a week. Everyone gets together, and we all
just teach each other Ojibwe. I go to two tables regularly. At one of them we get into some pretty
advanced grammar, and at the other there are people who can barely tell us what their name is.
(“So-and-So indizhinikaaz.”) Whatever the level is, though, there’s just no substitute for speaking
the language in real time with your real mouth with real people.

Besides which, the people are after all really the point.

I’m not learning Ojibwe for the satisfaction of working out the puzzle of its conjugations, after
all. I’m learning it to learn a way of living and understanding the world that is the heritage of
real people who really live it.

Now, the people who come to these language tables live in the city, and they live in the 21st
century. They’re all people with individual lives. Going to the language tables isn’t like going
back four hundred years to do some sort of ethnographic study of the Ojibwe people’s pre-invasion
lifeways.

But there is, still, such a thing as Ojibwe culture. It’s alive and well, and it’s not the same
thing as U.S. culture, despite the best efforts of a hundred years of assimilation policy. It
belongs to the present; it’s not built around a veneration for the past and a wish that it would
return exactly as it was. Its stories and teachings have wisdom that people can use right now and 
in the future.

And the core of that wisdom is, indeed, passed down from the thousands and thousands of years in
which the Anishinaabe people lived from the Earth, lived closely with it and had to know everything
about how to understand it and keep it healthy to keep themselves healthy. And I believe that wisdom
is important: now more than perhaps ever in history. And it’s all this---the religion, the language,
the circle of the year, the present and the everyday, all a tapestry from which you can’t sensibly
isolate strands---that I want to learn.

“But,” you might say. “But you’re white! Haven’t you ever heard of cultural appropriation?”

I am, and I have, and I’ve spent a long time thinking about the same question. I was hesitant the
first time I went to a language table. I made sure to clarify very early that I’m white, that
I don’t have any meaningful amount of Native blood in me, that the most Native part of my childhood
was when my mom rented *Smoke Signals*. And someone asked me, curiously, what got me interested in
learning the language, and then we just had a normal language table, and they treated me exactly the
same as anyone else. The same thing happened at the second language table I went to. I asked if
there was anything I should be aware of, any boundaries not to step over. The teacher told me a few
things about Anishinaabe etiquette that someone who grew up white might not know, but he didn’t tell
me there was anything I should stay away from because I wasn’t born Native.

It’s been like that wherever I’ve gone. The Chippewa Tribe, as far as the United States Government
is concerned, is defined by your blood quantum, and if you don’t have at least such-and-so fraction
of documented ancestry from enrolled band members, then you’re not part of the tribe. When you take
the government out of the picture, though, what I’ve been gathering is that the boundaries are much
more porous. I know at least three people who are white by ancestry and have been given Anishinaabe
names. (One is named Asabikeshiinh-inini, which translates to Spider-man.) I’ve never seen anyone
get turned away or even get looked at askance because they were too white.

Something that does matter, of course, is that you’re not just in it for the money, or just to take
without giving. One of the most basic values in the Anishinaabe worldview is that you have to give
back. If the world gives you good luck (in hunting, in your job, wherever), or even just gives you
a beautiful day or a sight of eagles flying overhead, you offer tobacco in return. If you’re given
knowledge, similarly, it’s expected for you to give back by sharing that knowledge with someone else
who’s ready for it, because your teacher clearly felt it was worth sharing. Once when I asked if it
was okay for me to be relaying language teachings to Misty (who was in a little over their head at
the language tables), my teacher said, “This is for everyone. Everyone should be speaking Ojibwe.”
Everywhere I’ve gone, I’ve been invited to learn and participate.

And that, finally, is how and why I got to sugarbush.
