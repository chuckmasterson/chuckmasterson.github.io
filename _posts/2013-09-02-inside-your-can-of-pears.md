A few weeks ago, on my way out west, I was in Willmar (say
“Wilmer”), Minnesota. Willmar is an unusual town: after I was
dropped off there, I walked through it a bit, and noticed that pretty much
everyone besides me was pretty clearly from Africa. The fact that they black
and were speaking a language I didn’t even recognize, or maybe various
languages, was a giveaway. A small town an hour outside Minneapolis isn’t
generally the sort of place you expect to hear Somali. Later I learned that
there’s a Jennie-O turkey processing plant in town. Americans do not wish
to disassemble the turkey you buy at the store. People from poor countries can
also presumably think of other things they’d rather do, but whatever
peanuts Jennie-O is willing to pay them are enough to convince them to leave
their homes and come to a land where they speak a strange language and, for
several months of the year, water becomes hard enough to drive trucks over.

Carrying my huge backpack, I walked into a pizza joint and got
my water bottles filled up. When I came out, a man in a white pickup was
waiting for me. “Hi! How’s it going?” he said. “You
speak English?”

“Yeah,” I said, uncomprehending.

“Oh. Thought you might be Hispanic, looking for a job,” he said.

“Oh! No, I’m just traveling. Though I might not be averse to taking
a job if there is one.  What is it?”

“Well, I need some people to cut flowers. It has to be done quick.”
He explained it’d be three or four days, and would pay pretty well,
quoting a rate that was high enough that I wonder if I misheard him. But I was
at least two weeks into my “Out West” leg of travel and still
hadn’t made it out west, and I was getting a little antsy for that. So I
told him I had my heart set on doing that the next few days, and he said okay
and almost immediately drove off, never to be seen again. Only minutes later, I
regretted it. That would’ve made an amazing surprise twist to my story!
With the other guys in whatever crew this guy hired, I would’ve gotten to
practice my Spanish, make a little money, and learn some things about the lives
of itinerant immigrants. And I even would’ve gotten a little farther
west, since the flowers were near the South Dakota border.

I ended up getting to Montana within the next couple days, but the seed from
that little drive-by disorientation had started growing, and I decided I would
go out to where there were harvesting jobs and take one to make up for the one
I’d missed in Willmar.

From various directions, I learned that the place to go would be the Yakima
Valley in Washington, where they grow fruit. Mostly they’re famous for
apples, and you may have seen the occasional “Washington” sticker
on an apple you’ve had. But they grow a few other fruits there: pears,
peaches, nectarines.

I rode into Yakima with a guy who was heading to Denver to see his girlfriend.
My main thought as we got close to town was: This does not look like a very
promising place for fruit orchards. It was desert country; all up and down the
steep valleys along the highway, the only plants I could see were shin-high
tufts of sagebrush, green dots scattered over the drab, dry earth. I thought
perhaps we’d round a bend and come to a suddenly lush area, a river
running through a green valley with trees on all sides, but it was sagebrush
all the way to Yakima. I found a spot to camp and went to sleep.

The next morning I got on the job hunt. What everyone had told me when I
mentioned I wanted to pick fruit was that that sounded like a good idea,
because there was so much fruit, and they had to attract people from far and
wide every year to get it all out of the trees. For all that, though, the
orchard owners sure weren’t mobbing me. I spent a whole day getting the
runaround. I checked first with DSHS, a government agency I’d been
recommended to ask at. They told me to go to an employment agency across town,
WorkSource. When I got there, I filled out a long, pointless form and then
waited to talk with someone on staff there. The guy I talked to looked at my
form, told me I didn’t have the three months’ picking experience
wanted by the two fruit companies that were staffing through them, and shredded
my form. He told me to check out any of four staffing agencies in town. So I
walked to one of those, where a wide-eyed woman told me, “Sorry, this
isn’t the kind of place where you can just walk in and get a job on the
spot… but, you’re such a beautiful person… are you
traveling?” She gave me some Cheez-It-type snacks and a weird feeling,
and directed me to one of the other agencies. The next one was just a big
concrete-gray room where people were watching a safety instructional video, and
gave me an inhospitable “We could fit you in on Monday”. I took a
bus back to where I’d started and tried another agency, where I got told
once more that they don’t do that and you have to come in for an
interview sometime, at which point I concluded that these employment agencies
serve only as a barrier to actual employment. But he was also able to tell me
that, up that hill there, there are couple orchards where I could ask.

So I walked up the hill.  The main orchard had a boutiquey front building where
an nice old woman told me she was pretty sure they had a full crew already, but
I might try the orchard next door. There I stepped into an actual orchard for
the first time. None of the trees were more than about ten feet tall, and all
the ones I could see were empty of fruit, because there was a crew of several
people going in and out of the trees picking it. One guy was on a tractor
stacking and lining up massive wooden bins of pears. I hailed him and he
stopped, and told me that unfortunately he was all crewed up and almost done
picking. But he suggested that I might have some luck a little further west in
the next town over.

I hitched there with a guy who had to do a couple errands first, like giving a
card to the vet who had to put down his daughter’s horse last week.
Thanks to that, we came into town by an unusual route that went by some huge
fruit warehouses with thousands of bins stacked in front of them. I decided to
try a new approach, and went into the office of one of them, where truckers
were going in and out and getting slips indicating the weight of their load of
fruit, and also two women, one of them a midget, delivered a couple dozen
homemade cookies for the employees. The woman behind the desk told me
she’d ask her boss and call me then. While I waited, I went across the
street to another warehouse. I asked the woman behind *this* desk,
“I was just wondering if you know of anyone who needs fruit
pickers?” She was just about to say no, but then a guy standing on my
left pointed to a guy standing on my right and said, “This guy.”
This Guy asked if I’d ever picked before and if I had transportation,
both questions with unflattering answers, but he still told me the address of a
“pear block” where there would be some picking tomorrow at six in
the morning.

Hitching, bussing, and walking, I got there some hours later, a little before
dark. Exhausted from all the runaround, I wrote in my journal and went straight
to sleep in the trees.

I woke up a little after five in the morning so as not to be sleeping in
the orchard when everyone got there to start picking. In the chilly predawn, I
sat by the side of the road waiting for people to show up. I didn’t know
who they would be, or how many, or when they’d show up. The sheer
mysterious anticipation was enough to keep me interested and awake, if not
energetic. Around 5:30, they appeared: cars, pickups, and SUVs of extremely
miscellaneous appearance. I followed them down the dirt path to the other side
of the orchard and out came Mexicans, exclusively Mexicans, not a word of
English to be heard. I told a couple of them I was there to pick fruit. They
basically said, “Okay,” and then stopped paying any attention
whatsoever to me. Eventually everyone got word that they should congregate at
the other parking lot, where I’d been waiting before. There I asked
around and met the boss of the crew, also a Mexican, and he told me that I
could probably pick, depending on how many people showed up. Somewhere north of
thirty-five eventually did, and we all gathered in a big circle to hear the
rules imposed by this particular fruit company (Del Monte). This all happened
in Spanish, so I missed a couple of them, but I got the gist: no smoking in the
orchard, no peeing, no eating outside food (especially not fruit), no using
pears that have touched the ground. And then, all of them knowing just what
they were doing, they got their fruit-picking sacks, selected a ladder each,
headed out into the trees, and started picking pears.

I didn’t have a sack, so one had to be found for me, which took a couple
hours. I hadn’t even thought about it, but a proper sack is something you
can’t pick fruit without, at least industrially. It hangs at your waist,
so when you pick a pear you throw it, in a way that feels fairly natural, into
your lap, or where your lap would be if you weren’t standing up most of
the time. I watched the process while I waited for my own sack: once it’s
full, you take it to your big wooden bin and empty it out, and then go back to
the tree, probably reposition your ladder so it’s near more fruit, and
get back to work filling up that sack.

Once I got a sack, I went at it with top energy. I figured it wouldn’t
take too long for that to flag, but for a while I was almost making up for my
inexperience at picking fruit with sheer energy. But within a few hours, I
turned out to be right and I settled into a more consistent, beaten-down
pattern. See, despite how useful it is, the sack is also the one thing that
does the most to make fruit-picking really suck. Because this is not a small
sack: when it’s full, it’s probably got fifty pounds of pears in
it. You could empty it out more frequently, but then you’d slow yourself
down and get paid less. So you’re stuck in a tree with a sack that hangs
from what seems to be exactly the most sensitive part of your shoulders,
getting heavier and heavier while your upper back gets (over the hours and
days) achier and achier.

I slowly discovered the other things that I’d never expected.
Here’s one: pear trees ooze sticky, sugary sap from every twig, and
you’re spending your entire day right up in the leaves and branches.  By
lunchtime each day my hands were pretty much the dirtiest they’ve ever
been, all the way up to the elbows, covered in stickiness with pearwood debris
and dust ground into it, so filthy that I tried to avoid touching any other
part of myself. Luckily there was a little water available so I could clean my
hands enough to face the thought of eating lunch with them.

I learned about the nature of pears on the tree. First off, these trees have
*so many pears* on them. We’re talking at least a few hundred on
each tree. A lot of times you can’t pick one without inadvertently
knocking one or four others out of the tree just by touching them a little. You
can spend a solid couple minutes or more harvesting the pears off of just one
*branch*. I don’t know how long it took to breed pear trees that are so
absurdly fecund, but they seem to me like genetic freaks, along the lines of
the [Komondor](http://retrieverman.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/komondor.jpg)
breed of dreadlock-dog or the plants that grow pumpkins weighing eighteen
hundred pounds. Of course, that’s par for the course for industrial
agriculture, but you don’t think of pears as being produced by the same
efficiency-first strategies that give us monocultures of corn.

It is monocultures out there, though, more or less—acres of just pears, nothing
to replenish the soil; I can only assume massive loads of fertilizers are
trucked in each year. And they’re also grown in a climate that I find
absolutely puzzling. It never stopped being desertland out here; all around the
orchards are yellowed, dried pastures. They irrigate the hell out of these
orchards. I can’t quite fathom where they get all the water. One waterway
I saw, with the headscratcher of a name Lmuma Creek, was completely dry; there
was also the Yakima River and the Naches River, and I didn’t see them to
know where their water levels were, but I can’t imagine there was much
left in them after the hundreds or maybe thousands of orchards in the valley
each took their share. I guess it all works out, but at what cost to the
ecosystem? Can it be done forever?

Genetic oddness aside, something else I discovered immediately is that we
weren’t picking these pears ripe. Pears are a soft fruit when
they’re ripe, the kind of fruit that wouldn’t really stand up well
to being tossed into a giant bin and then having a thousand pounds of other
pears piled on top of it. The pears in these trees were as hard as raw
potatoes. They were basically indestructible.  In *Stuffed and Starved*, a book
I recently read about the world’s food system, the author laments that
there are incredibly delicious varieties of apples that almost nobody will ever
experience because supermarkets won’t buy them because they just
don’t ship well. They go bad too quickly, or they’re too soft to
withstand the shipping, or they don’t do well if you refrigerate them.
You end up with only a select few really durable varieties that have proven to
sell well. I assume the same thing has happened with pears. I don’t
actually know for sure what variety I was picking; I think they were Bartletts.
That and Anjou are probably the only two varieties of pear you can name unless
you pay unusually close attention to pears. We’re not getting a lot in
the way of choices. And for all that sturdiness, these weren’t even the
kind that are attractive enough, in the end, to be profitable when sold fresh.
All the pears I picked will end up canned. Some yet more special variety is the
kind you buy to eat on its own.

From a more practical standpoint as I picked them, I also learned that pears do
not like to relinquish their hold on their tree. Before I started picking, a
guy I asked who had experience with various fruits told me that apples were the
worst one to pick, and peaches were the best. I think he can’t have
possibly picked pears. This orchard had a few rows of apples too, and when I
picked them it was so much easier than picking pears. My first day and a half
or so, I would yank on the pear with everything I had, and all that would
happen would be that the branch would bend down to my chest (and of course
shake off all the more cooperative pears located elsewhere along its length). I
sometimes had to use both hands, one on the pear and one on the branch, a
highly inefficient use of my hands. Later I discovered there’s a sort of
twisting motion you can use to make the stem snap where it would naturally
dehisce. That works at least most of the time, if you get the direction right.
But picking still goes pretty slow.

It went slow for me, at least. The size of these bins is hard to get used to.
Even before you start trying to fill one, it looks massive, easily big enough
for four children to squeeze into. (Elementary schools might look into this as
a way to save on transportation costs for long-distance field trips.) Once you
start emptying your sack into it, you start to truly appreciate how many pears
fit into that space. It takes four or five backbreaking loads of pears brought
down from the tree before you even cover the bottom. Getting them up to the top
of the bin always took me at least about three hours, more like four in the
beginning.

The pay for filling one bin is eighteen dollars.

I worked for most of the time with no clear idea of how fast the rest of the
pickers were going. I picked two bins a day on my first three days, since they
were somewhat shortened and I was still learning.  On the third day, I picked
three, and felt victorious though at the price of totally destroyed shoulder
muscles. I couldn’t even turn my head in certain directions. I sat in the
parking area to wait for the guy who would take me home, and another picker
came out of the trees to go home. After some perfunctory greetings, he asked
me, “How many bins did you pick today?”

“Three, and two each day before that, but I’m new and I’m
learning.”

He nodded. “Mm. Today I picked six.”

I boggled. “Really? Whoa.”

“Yep. Here are the slips.  See?” Just in case I really wanted proof
that I wasn’t good at this. “Tomorrow if it doesn’t rain I
might pick eight. One day I picked twelve!”

And here I’d thought I was doing pretty well. “Super-picker,”
I told him a bit glumly.

“Pretty much,” he said. “Well, you’ve got to make lots
of money. And it’s good exercise too.” He did look like he was in
excellent shape. *Some people say a man is made out of mud / A poor man’s
made outta muscle and blood / Muscle and blood and skin and bone / A mind
that’s weak and a back that’s strong.*

So if you’re ever tempted to think that Mexicans are shiftless or lazy,
consider how your pears got off the tree and into that can. It’s
something I’d never really considered before. What comes between a fruit
growing on its tree and appearing in the store? Well (I might once have said,
if pressed), it falls off or some kind of machine shakes it down or something,
and then somehow or other they get collected and go to the store. If humans had
to pick them, in my imagination, it was a pretty simple job that couldn’t
take more than a few minutes per tree, because surely they came off easily and
there was some super-efficient way of collecting them and it was all smoothly
industrialized. Nope, your fruit comes off its tree the old-fashioned way: a
poor person physically grabs it and pulls it off. Next time you go to buy
apples or pears or peaches, look at the price and consider how hard the work
was that went into that number, and who was the person willing to get dirty
enough to do it, day after day, season after season. 

There’s not really anything I’m saying you should change about your
relationship with fruit. In fact, even the pesticide situation didn’t seem too
horrible. I talked a bit with the area orchard manager, the sole white guy I
saw involved in the whole process (besides the one in the warehouse), and he
told me that back in the ’60s, his father used to go into the orchards with his
partner, spraying DDT everywhere with a giant hose. Sometimes it would get hot
and they would spray it on each other. Nowadays there’s only one pesticide left
that they’re allowed to use that’s proven to be harmful to humans, and they use
that one several months before the picking.  That’s not to say that the other
pesticides they’re still allowed to use are good for you just because the FDA
says there’s nothing wrong with them; almost certainly you’d be better off
without them. But they actually seem like they’ve made pretty good strides in
doing things responsibly. There’s a moth that bores into the developing fruits
to lay its eggs, and then its larvae eat the fruit and ruin it. Some genius
solved this problem for them: they hang little plastic loops throughout the
orchard that are full of tremendous amounts of this moth’s female pheromones.
The moths still come into the orchard, but when a male looks for a female, it
can’t find her because everything smells like female moth, and so the male just
flies around aimlessly and they both end up dying sexually frustrated but at
least not poisoned, and no eggs are laid.

Now, that said, I’m still concerned about how much water and fertilizer
needs to get moved in order to make these pears, and fruit from your
farmers’ market would be way better, and farmers’ markets do remain
the way of the future and you should really buy all your groceries from them.
But that’s not the lesson I’m particularly drawing from my four
days in the pear orchards. All I’m pointing out right now is that between
the tree and your can of pears, there’s a lot more than just a magical
teleportation, and you probably never thought about it. I know I didn’t.
