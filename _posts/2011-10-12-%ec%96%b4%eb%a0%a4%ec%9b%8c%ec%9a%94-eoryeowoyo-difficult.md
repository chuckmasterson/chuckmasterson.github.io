I think I’m going to write about language. Hopefully that won’t
scare everyone off. As a reward, I’ll also write about my latest trip to
Busan. I suppose I can’t prevent you from just skipping down to that,
but, you know, it’s the spirit of the thing.

I came with aspirations of picking up a ton of Korean more or less instantly.
In my plan, by now I’d be able to carry on a pretty decent conversation.
At the end of the year, I’d be able to read sophisticated novels. Maybe
I’ll still be able to read some books, but Korean turns out to be a far
trickier language than I’d figured on. Of course, every language has its
own idiosyncratic difficulties. Russian has a distinction between things
you’ve finished doing and things you haven’t finished. Finnish has
fifteen cases (for comparison, English has two, and only for pronouns).
Japanese has probably the most unwieldy writing system on the planet. Lots and
lots of languages have tones, which we speakers of toneless languages just
can’t hear. But that’s one or two difficulties per language. Korean
seems to have them in every direction I turn.

For example, in Korean you have to think totally backwards. There’s the
small matter that the word order is Subject-Object-Verb, instead of
Subject-Verb-Object like in English, so you’d say “The dog the man
bit” rather than “The dog bit the man”. That’s
different, but easy to get used to. There are much bigger issues than this at
hand. Like this: in English, if you want to say more about the dog in this
sentence, you can say something like “The dog that peed on my lawn bit
the man.” But Korean is aggressively _right-headed_, which means that the
most important part of any phrase (the head) has to come at the end (the right
side). The dog is the head here, so you have to say it like this: “The
peed-on-my-lawn dog the man bit.” This gets really awkward when the
sentences get elaborate. “The dog that I bought earlier from the flea
market where they have ice cream just bit the man in the expensive-looking
suit” becomes “The
I-bought-earlier-from-the-_they-have-ice-cream_-flea-market dog the
wearing-an-expensive-looking-suit man bit.” Or, “I dreamt that you
were a robot” becomes “I a you-were-a-robot dream dreamt.”
Prepositions are backwards too, which means really they’re what you could
call postpositions. That “on my lawn” would be “my lawn
on”.

Korean has all the wrong pronouns. In a chart of pronouns, there are big gaps
in some places, but then in other places there are lots of pronouns all crowded
in. There are two ways to say “I” (_cheo_ and _na_), depending on
how humble you’re being. Same with “we” (_cheohui_ and
_uri_). But there’s almost no such thing as “you”. You can
say _neo_, but only to little kids and animals. There’s also _dangsin_,
but that’s only for lovers. If you say either of these to the wrong
person (i.e., almost anyone), it’s a grave insult. You have to use their
name and then their occupation. If you don’t know their occupation you
can call them a teacher (_seonsaengnim_). If you know them pretty well
you’re allowed to forget their occupation and call them _ssi_, which is
more or less “Mr/Mrs/Miss”. So, you actually have to go out of your
way to obey this grammar—when Koreans meet a new person, they spend a few
minutes at the very beginning asking things like, “What’s your
name? How old are you? What’s your job?” If you’re homeless,
I assume you’re made to feel like a failure every time you speak to
someone.

Or how about this difficulty? The verbs agglutinate, which means you can keep
on adding stuff to the end and conjugate any verb in hundreds of different
ways. (Theoretically, at least; in practice, most of them don’t come into
play, but that still leaves a whole lot of them viable.) There are seven
different slots after the stem of your verb, and in each slot you can put
nothing at all or any one of dozens of different things. Also, each of those
things is liable to squish together with things next to it. So you can outfit
the verb _ha-da_ (“to do”) with these options: ha-si-eo-yo. But
_si_ and _eo_ combine into _e_. So it’s “haseyo”. They do
this every time they say hello, which is “Annyeong haseyo?” (Is it
going peacefully? or literally, Is peace doing?) Or a more formal hello is,
“Annyeong hasimnikka?” which breaks down into ha-si-p-ni-kka. What
do these little bits mean? Well, _si_ is for politeness. _p_ makes it formal.
_ni_ goes with the formal style. _kka_ makes it a question. Three of these four
things show politeness, and this phrase doesn’t even take the polite _yo_
on the end that you can tack on in most places. The politeness situation is
dire.

Numbers? Yep, those are difficult too. There are two counting systems, one of
them native Korean, one imported from Chinese. They sound nothing alike. Take a
look: from one to ten, with the native Korean one first, they’re:
1=hana/il; 2=dul/i; 3=set/sam; 4=net/sa; 5=daseot/o; 6=yeoseot/yuk;
7=ilgop/chil, 8=yeodeol/pal; 9=ahop/gu; 10=yeol/sip. When do you use which one?
You just have to memorize the contexts. For telling time, you use the native
Korean numbers for the hours and the Chinese numbers for the minutes, meaning
that 10:10 is read _yeol si sip bun_ (_si_ is hours and _bun_ is minutes). Your
age is in native Korean numbers. Money is in Chinese numbers. When you’re
counting things in general -- well, that’s in Korean numbers, but
it’s worse yet. You need something called counters. All right, so in
English, we say “three sheets of paper” or “two bottles of
water”, but just “five students”. The “sheets” or
“bottles” there is like a counter in Korean, but they use them with
_everything_. It’s as if you were saying “five people of
student” or “two machines of car”. There are dozens, maybe
hundreds, of counters in Korean that you have to memorize. Mercifully, you can
get along pretty well with a few basic ones, including _gae_
“thing”. (Give me two things of chair, please.)

Even just the sounds are hard. They have, for example, _g, kk,_ and _k,_ and
all three sound like an English _k_. The double and single _s_ seem to be
nearly identical (in fact, I hear even some Koreans have stopped trying to keep
them from merging). The vowel _eo_ sounds like the vowel _o_, but you have to
be able to tell them apart, because for example there are two neighborhoods,
Sinchon and Sincheon, and while the first one is a hip party area, the second
one is full of businesses and would be very little fun on a Friday night.

All right, how about something simple, like the word “and”. That
can’t be too bad. But you’d be wrong. In fact, there are at least
six totally different ways to say “and” in Korean. First, are you
joining together nouns or sentences? If it’s nouns, you can use _-hago_,
which you tack onto the end of the first noun. So “coffee and
cigarettes” would be _keopi-hago dambae_. But wait! If you want to sound
slightly more colloquial, you can say _(i)rang_, like so: _keopi-rang dambae_.
Remember to put in that spare _(i)_ if the noun ends in a consonant. Donuts and
coffee is _doneot-irang keopi_. But wait! Are you writing this down? If so, you
ought to use _(k)wa_, which is the kind of _and_ that you use in print:
_keopi-wa dambae_, or _doneot-kwa keopi_. All of these also mean
“with”, so don’t forget that either. All right, and if
you’re joining sentences? Oh, well then things get complicated! If you
want to sound clunky and totally un-stylish you can put _geurigo_ between the
sentences. “I bought coffee and I ate a donut” is _Cheo-neun keopi
sasseoyo geurigo doneot meogeosseoyo_. If you want to do it right, though, you
need to conjugate “and” into the verb; in this case
“and” is _go_, as in _keopi sago doneot meogeosseoyo._ But if you
want to say “and so”, you can’t put “so”
(_geuraeseo_) after your “and”; you have to use the special
“and so” ending, which makes your sentence _keopi saseo doneot
meogeosseoyo_ (that is, “I bought coffee, and so I ate a donut”).
I’m pretty sure there are several more of these, but let’s move on.

I’m slowly getting used to these sorts of things, and I can use them in
sentences sometimes, although I certainly don’t want to give the
impression that my sentences aren’t lamebrain short ones. (I say
“Is there X?” a lot. It’s easy: _X isseoyo?_) And now I can
understand, to an extent, why Korean students have so much trouble with English
-- they have some of the same problems with English, but the other way
around. But the real trouble is that I don’t know all the difficult bits,
and the Koreans do, and they use them in pretty much every sentence they say,
it seems. So I can make myself understood, but figuring out what the hell
someone is saying is another matter altogether. I got my friend’s bike
fixed yesterday. It just needed a new chain, that’s all. I asked the guy
how much, as he was putting on the new chain. 60,000 won, he said -- about
$50! I told him (in Korean), “That’s a little expensive!”
-- but then he said something in Korean that was short but went completely
over my head. I heard the number 12,000 in there, but that was not the new
price. I still had to pay W60,000, because at this point the chain was already
on, and I was in a hurry to get back to the house in time to start walking
around and looking at the fall colors with everyone. I bet a Korean
would’ve paid about W20,000. See if I ever go to his bike shop again,
though.

Okay, I promised to write about my trip to Busan. It was for 10/10, you see.
10/10 is Grinnell’s premiere party of the fall semester, commemorating
the old days when everyone got their first work-study paycheck on October 10th
and blew it all immediately on booze. And it turns out there are a number of
Grinnellians here this year, besides Jo. It was thus clearly necessary to
recreate 10/10 in Busan. The Grinnellians are people who were in my graduating
class but who I never really knew very well. There’s Pat, a Russian major
who sort of organized this party; Hoh, a Korean-American with a mind that stays
on a single track that may or may not be everyone else’s; Stony, a big
guy who loves to party and played sports; Rob, who also is big and loves to
party, and additionally loves to dance and be affectionate with strangers; and
Erin, whose cat lived at EcoHouse for a semester or so.

I believe I’ve written before about how long it takes to get around this
country despite its size. Well, the trip to Busan was a perfect demonstration
of that. I left directly after work. I arrived on the Mugunghwa train into
Busan at 4:10 am. But the Night 1 party was still underway, and only just
beginning to end. We got drinks from a convenience store and soon ended up in a
beef stew place, where we all ate a lot and enjoyed ourselves a great deal. By
this time the sun had risen and the subway had started running again, so we
rode to our accommodations for the night (the morning, really). It was a
jjimjilbang -- a bathhouse.

I’d never been to one before. It was a very big, very quiet place, and we
all toned our voices down several notches as we got our keys from the front
desk. Each of us trying to follow the other’s lead in this strange place,
we put our shoes in little lockers, then walked into the main locker room,
which had lots of lockers and also lots of naked Korean men. Since we were only
tired and not even a little interested in bathing or a sauna, we moved quickly
through the locker room without even looking into the room full of baths and
emerged into the crashing room. I don’t know what it’s called in
Korean, but it was a dark, quiet room full of people sleeping on the floor on
little blankets. There was a little snack counter too, and the woman behind it
saw us looking puzzled and gave us blankets. I stepped out onto the floor. It
was heated, but hard. But at 7:00 in the morning, I didn’t care about the
hardness. I got a little cubic pillow and slept.

When everyone woke up a few hours later, I didn’t have a hangover,
because I’d had maybe two drinks before the beef stew, so I decided to
try the main part of the jjimjilbang experience. I stowed my clothes in the
locker and entered a very hot room with an amazing amount of water flowing.
First there was a bank of showers; it’s expected that you hose down
before getting in the water. Next there were four pools, each one a rectangle
big enough for a couple dozen people. The pools were arranged in this order:
hot; scalding; cold; warm with jets. At the top there was a frigid pool big
enough to swim in. I tried them all. My favorite was the hot one. Then I kind
of lost interest, or maybe it was just that I felt weird being the only
foreigner in the bathhouse. Anyhow, I got dressed and joined up with everyone
else and we left.

Hoh was set on having pufferfish. The rest of us didn’t know
Busan’s specialties, so we didn’t have strong convictions about
what to eat while we were in Busan, and we ended up following him to a small
but extremely busy and classy pufferfish restaurant in Haeundae, just a quick
sprint away from the beach. To get there we walked through the fish market.
This place had everything from the ocean that you could possibly want to eat,
and a great many other things that you wouldn’t. Just in the tanks where
they kept living things, there were crabs, fish of every description, oysters,
eels, sea cucumbers (which looked exactly like disembodied penises), and other
things that I’ve forgotten. I have no idea what the other stuff I saw
was, the stuff that wasn’t alive. Anyhow, the pufferfish turned out to be
unremarkable. The only thing special about pufferfish is that if you prepare it
wrong it can be lethal, but as you have deduced, it was prepared right when I
ate it, so it was basically just some fish. Not bad, though. It’s just
that I think the only reason people talk about it is that there’s a small
but non-zero risk that you’ll suddenly die.

Then we hung out on the beach, just talking. I would’ve swum, but I only
had long pants. So I stayed dry and talked for a few hours.

As six o’clock got along, we started feeling that it might be time to
start the night. I was introduced to the strawpedo, a very effective method of
chugging alcohol. Things progressed in this way for quite a while. We moved at
one point to Seomyeon, farther from the beach but with an abundance of bars,
and we picked up and lost people in a casual way. One who hung on all night was
a non-Grinnell friend of Hoh’s, Anthony. We ate and drank and wandered
and everything went swimmingly. Rob kissed Korean men and sang popular English
songs with them. We ate at a Lotteria -- that’s a Korean fast food
chain, run by the omnicorporation Lotte -- and three Korean men that Rob
had befriended earlier bought us milkshakes. Later he danced in the street and
it was impressive enough that the crowd cleared a big space for him. None of
the rest of us can boast achievements that impressive for the night, although I
do have one bit of bragging rights -- Anthony and I didn’t feel like
going into the last club, mainly because of its W20,000 cover, so we played
pool instead at 3 in the morning, and I won one of our two-out-of-three series
plus the tiebreaker match we had. And Hoh led us around most of the night,
which was an accomplishment given that he was usually trying to take us
somewhere we didn’t want to go (most of the night, he was fixed on a
sushi restaurant). I had a heck of a time.

We came back to the jjimjilbang and slept. This time there were no blankets
left, so I slept on a surreal patch of artificial grass they had on the side of
the room. After I woke up, we decided to try and sweat out some alcohol in the
sauna, which was a great idea, and then we walked around looking for food.
Pizza Hut rose to the call. Then we split up. I went to Busan Station for
trains with Stony and Pat. I sat next to Stony on the KTX, Korea’s
version of the bullet train. It goes from Busan to Seoul in 2½ hours.
Unfortunately, I was unable to appreciate either this speed or Stony’s
company, because I slept the whole way, and then my Busan story was over. So
that’s all.
