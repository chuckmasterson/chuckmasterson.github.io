Today I overslept, and then I picked up Aaron’s brother Jeremy to go make bows
and arrows with Mr Lorenz. Jeremy is still at Finneytown Secondary Campus --
the poor fellow -- as a senior. Mr Lorenz is the sole French teacher and the
coach of the academic team, and in his spare time he makes bows, arrows,
trebuchets, and other assorted awesome stuff. If you’d like to picture him,
he’s the tallest person on the Finneytown Secondary Campus, and he has light
brown hair, and no one I know has ever seen him in a mode other than happy. I
drove us to his house, although I managed to take us many miles in the wrong
direction first. I’ve got the driving thing fine; the next hurdle is
navigation. I actually don’t think I’m that bad at navigation, it’s just that
Cincinnati is complicated in places. I do take the blame for going west instead
of east. Anyhow.  

We got to his house, and went into his small backyard, where he had a table
full of tools, a garage full of wood, and a few rock benches with more wood. He
has a lot of stuff. He picked out a long stick of yew for Jeremy, who
apparently had discussed earlier with him what kind of bow he’d like to make.
Then he picked up a piece of walnut that he’d vaguely started working with, and
showed me what to do with it. I started working on it with a planer, shaving it
down to the right shape. With the planer it was some painfully slow going. Then
he gave me a drawknife he had, and the work magically disappeared. I had the
general shape of the bow fleshed out pretty soon after that, and then I spent a
while fine-tuning it with the planer. Meanwhile, Jeremy sat on a
[Schnitzelbank](http://www2.mcdaniel.edu/Chemistry/WOOD/shvghrseflower1.jpg)
and hacked away at his yew stick with a machete. Interspersed into all this
bow-making action, though, we had fun. For example, we got to meet all the
little Lorenzes. I think they’re 11, 6, and 5. The 11-year-old was Seth, who
was working on a bow of his own. The others were his two daughters, who are
pretty darn cute (and like to talk a _lot_). Also, he got pizza for everyone
for lunch, and we ate that. Also, when I went to use his bathroom, I discovered
that he has the old style of toilet with the tank up above and a pull cord to
flush it. Basically, he’s awesome. We also made a few arrows today. I gave him
one of the arrowheads I’ve been making on Fridays when I’m not too exhausted to
go knap flint, and I used another to make an arrow for myself.  

Unfortunately, there were too few hours in the day, and we didn’t get to the
end of any bows. But we’re going to go back next Saturday and finish the job.
We didn’t finish the arrows, either, because the glue holding on the flights
(feathers) would’ve taken too long to set. Instead, Mr Lorenz is just going to
fletch them all himself (he’s making a few with regular metal points), and
they’ll be ready when we come back. Hopefully next Saturday will be enough time
to finish these bows, because I do look forward to having a self-made bow. How
awesome will that be?  

That’s about all I’ve got for this post. Before you go, I want to mention this:
Mom’s been feeling pretty poorly lately. Mom, I hope you feel better as soon as
physically possible, and everyone else, wellwishes are appreciated.
