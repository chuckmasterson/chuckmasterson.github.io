So here I am in Minneapolis. I’m visiting my friend Savannah from back at
Grinnell. I only barely got to know her while I was there, but now we know each
other a fair amount better. She’s here working with an environmental
community-building organization. When she explains exactly what it is
she’s doing, it seems very complicated to me, but the upshot seems to be
this. A while ago a big Ford plant got closed down in St Paul. They want to use
that space as a place to grow gardens and have the community get together.
Meanwhile, they’re also figuring out ways to spread the buy-local
movement to poor communities, where they need it most. And somewhere thrown in
there, some people with her program (Grand Aspirations) are trying to get the
Cities to switch to more sustainable electricity. Her part in the whole thing
seems to involve lots of meetings, but she’s a no-nonsense get-stuff-done
type, so I have to assume, against my usual judgement, that the meetings are
actually doing something, or she wouldn’t have just signed on to stay
past the end of the summer doing more and more of them.

I’m staying with her at the house where she and all the other
people involved in the program stay, and it’s in an amazingly diverse
neighborhood where half the store signs are in Spanish and you can buy Thai
curry paste in the supermarket and there are Hmong vendors at the
farmers’ market and there’s a mural just down the street from us
that has birds painted in a Native American style, one saying
“Konklareeeee!” and the other saying “Kyowk!” I got a
ride there with a Cherokee woman who’s teaching Ojibway children at their
elementary school on the St Croix reservation just inside Wisconsin; when I
told her where in the city I was going, she said it was right by Little Earth,
the Indian part of town, and when she dropped me off there, she said,
“There’s an Indian now! You can tell because he’s got no
butt! He’s an Ojibwe!”

Savannah and I fairly
well toured the city yesterday. We went to three different farmers’
markets. At the first one I goggled and marveled at how many different vendors
there were.  “Wait ’til you see the big one,” she said.
And we went off biking on some of the city’s many bike trails. There are
heavily-used dedicated bike trails crisscrossing the whole city, all of them
well paved and not loud with car noise and aesthetically beautiful. Again:
“There’s *nothing* like this in Cincinnati!”
We got to the next market, the Mill City market. It was huge! And while we were
there she told me about the Mississippi River and flour mill history. There was
a big flea market’s worth of vendors stretched down a street and down a
long former train garage. And then it turned out that wasn’t even the big
one! The big one was downtown, and was just closing as we got there, but that
meant we could glean and get good deals. We got fresh fruit and free french
fries. If I lived in the Cities, I know where I’d do all my shopping.
(But what happens in winter?)

I guess what I’m getting
at is that as far as I can tell Minneapolis is superior to Cincinnati in every
way. Though I have yet to sample their local delicacy, the Jucy Lucy, which is
a hamburger with molten cheese inside the patty. Sometime I’ll be sure to
see how that stacks up.
