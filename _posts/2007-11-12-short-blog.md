This won’t be very long, but here are a few things.  

I made a couple new YouTube videos.
[One,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhA2Uur5TTQ)
[Two.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYFI-m-Xe3U) Total time about 5½ minutes.  

Grandma has broken her ankle. Grandma, I’m sorry that you broke your ankle.
Hope you feel better soon. Have you got a cast, or what?  

Yesterday, Jordan and I had some spare time, so he took me to Sugar Creek,
which is a nature preserve nearby. He’d told me about it, but I didn’t know
where it was, so he showed me. It was way better than I’d anticipated. First
off, it wasn’t just some trees given space at the edge of a field. It was a
proper forest, with full-size trees and a real live ecosystem. It’s way better
than Warder. It even looks like excellent krokay grounds. We walked through the
leaves downhill to the creek. It runs through a gully about four feet deep with
sheer walls, and its banks are deep thick mud, which was fun to walk in
[neither of us bothered with shoes]. We waded through the cold water to the
other side, and walked around a little more, then crossed back over and
leisurely navigated back up the hill to his car. Now I’m imagining having a
wicket on the other side of the gully, so that you have to jump your krokay
ball over the wide chasm. That would be _awesome_. I wish I knew a plastic
manufacturer that could do the machining I need in-house. If anyone knows a
company that can sell and machine 3&#8243;-diameter nylon 6,6 rods, give me a
shout.
