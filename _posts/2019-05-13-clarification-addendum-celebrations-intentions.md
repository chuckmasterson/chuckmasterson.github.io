### Clarification

From some of the replies I've gotten to my last post, I realize I didn’t actually make it clear
where I’m living now. I’m living in a little country house about halfway between Ashland and
Washburn, Wisconsin.

<!--sep-->

Ashland has 8,000 people and a tiny college that has 600 students; it used to have a dozen or so
giant docks, and was shot through with rails that were busy with ore trains coming to fill up
freighters, but the iron mines sank into unprofitability decades ago, and the last oredock was
finally torn down in 2012, leaving behind only a huge jetty and the now melancholy name of the high
school football team, the Oredockers.  Washburn, 6 miles north over the ice but 11 when you have to
go around the bay, is a quarter Ashland’s size and specializes in nice places to eat, of which
Ashland has a surprising paucity. Its streets are broader and its lawns more expansive, as befits
a town that tourists spend time in.  Although the real tourist draw is Bayfield, 12 more miles up
the shore, which boasts not only the ferry terminal for the spectacularly bougie Madeline Island but
also the annual Apple Festival, berry farms and vineyards all around it, and a farmers’ market all
its own despite a year-round population of 530 souls.

This house is a shade under two miles from the lake, though the shore there is clogged up by dream
homes and the closest beach is in Ashland. It’s surrounded by forest, and there are old apple trees
and a big garden that my landlady is gamely working to recover, having recently taken the place over
after more than a decade of neglect. She and her boyfriend have also just gotten chickens, and
they’re still timid little peeping pullets, starting to adventure outside their fence.

So that’s where I am.

### Addendum

I never explained it, but the subtitle to my last post, “Niigaanii Asemaa”, is a song that’s often
led in ceremonies around the Twin Cities area. It goes:

<section class="poem" markdown="1">

- *Niigaanii, niigaanii!*
- Niigaanii, niigaanii!
- Niigaanii asemaa,
- ’Semaa, niigaanii.
- Niigaanii, ’semaa, niigaanii.
- Midewakiing giizhibaashkaa!
- Midegiizhigoong giizhibaashkaa!
- Niigaanii asemaa,
- ’Semaa, niigaanii.
- Niigaanii, ’semaa, niigaanii.

</section>

*Niigaanii asemaa* translates to “Tobacco leads the way.” *Midewakiing giizhibaashkaa* is, more or
less, “It circles all around the sacred Earth,” and *Midegiizhigoong giizhibaashkaa* is “It circles
all around the sacred sky.”

What’s interesting is that when I went back to Minneapolis last week to watch the annual MayDay
Parade and Ceremony, which I’ll tell about more in a moment, that song was sung at the beginning of
the ceremony, the day after I’d used it to title a blog post. Which I take to mean that I’m on the
right path somehow or other.

### Celebration

The MayDay Parade has been happening every year for 45 years now. In a city that has a winter as
long, cold, and dark as Minneapolis, it’s important to mark when warmth and light come back. It’s
a parade unlike most. For one thing, it’s all human-powered, only bicycles and walking. For another,
instead of conventional floats, usually what you get is groups of fifteen-foot-tall papier-mâché
puppets, surrounded by stilt-walkers and raccoon-masked kids and all sorts of other things that tell
you it’s okay to go outside again, the Earth is waking up.

This was one of the best MayDays I can remember. For one thing, I got to really see the Battle
Train. This is a monstrosity put together by the South Side punks, many of whom are metalworkers or
bike mechanics, and pulled by a team of 50 galley slaves (volunteers) tugging on giant chains. The
puppets and stilt-walkers are great, of course, but I’ve seen them in previous parades---the Battle
Train I’ve only seen sitting around in the neighborhood, where different sections of it hulk
ominously near punk residences. I can show you pictures (like the one above), but this time I have
a video, and that’s the way to really understand.

People go *crazy* for MayDay. Remember, these Minnesotans have been pent up all winter with
worsening cases of cabin fever, and today is the day everyone lets loose and yells it out. If the
parade didn’t get us to let loose, the ceremony would give us the catharsis we need. It’s different
each year, basically a puppet-and-people show that addresses some important issue of the day. But it
always seems to include the classics: a crowd of people all banded together,

{% include fig.html src="spring19-2484.jpg" %}

the welcoming of the spirit of spring, 
{: .run-in }

{% include fig.html src="spring19-2485.jpg" %}

and most importantly, the return of the sun, which comes ashore from across the lake in a flotilla
of red canoes. By the time it gets to shore, everyone is shouting, “Sun! Sun! Sun!”, a drum roll is
building, and tears are coming to your eyes---and finally, landfall, and everything is released and
everyone goes nuts.
{: .run-in }

{% include fig.html src="spring19-2486.jpg" %}

Happy MayDay! Like I said, it was a terrific one for me, not just because of the Battle Train but
because of time I got to spend with my friends, and also a bizarre number of people I used to hang
out with who showed up out of nowhere. But I can't make a video of that. So you're just going to
have to enjoy that Mad Max metallic insanity.

### Intentions

I got me a banjo. I’ve been thinking about picking up an instrument for a while, and finally tracked
down a guy on Craigslist in St Paul who sold me a banjo. “You look like a banjo player,” he told me,
“so you’re already halfway there.” And my dad’s family is from West Virginia, so I’m even closer.
All I have to do is actually learn to play it. I’ve ordered a book to teach myself from, and I know
at least one person in Ashland and another in Minneapolis who can play it and maybe show me a thing
or two.

On a different twanging string:

In 2017 I went on a traditional Ojibwe four-day fast. It was a powerful enough experience that
I held off on writing about it until I could set aside the time to really get it right. Here I am
two years later and I still haven’t, but I’m getting ready to set out on another one. The fast is
held by Pebaamibines, the elder who presides over Porky’s Sugarbush with an arsenal of groaner jokes
and real wisdom, on the First Nation he grew up on, on the Canadian side of Rainy Lake. For four
sunrises I’ll be on an island in the lake and I won’t eat anything or drink any water but rainwater
(if some falls). That’s about all I’m going to say about it for now, except that afterwards I plan
to help out around camp in any capacity I can, and possibly go further north to spend time with
another elder I’ve met. I don’t know exactly when I’ll be back. For someone who’s finally settled
down, I’m traveling an awful lot, I know, but I think by the end of June it’ll all have calmed down.

Maybe then I can take that job at the dairy farm down the road. I was hitching back here the other
day after a few days in Minneapolis, and the people who got me to Ashland told me about a dairy farm
less than a mile from my house, where the guy needs help with morning and evening milkings and field
chores in between. A bit of morning milking would keep me honest by getting me up before sunrise,
and then I’d still have time during the rest of the day to do things like make a railbike.

A railbike? A railbike. It’s what it says on the tin: a bicycle you can ride on railroad tracks. So,
basically, it was invented to transport me into my own paradise. I’ll be building the [Dick Bentley
model](http://rrbike.freeservers.com/), and probably another for friends to come along. There are
tracks leading south from Ashland that were just abandoned two years ago, and ten or fifteen miles
down those, there’s an abandoned branch line that heads off into the Upper Peninsula and stops five
miles shy of Lake Superior at the power plant in the little town of White Pine, skirting the shores
of Lake Gogebic along the way. I expect to do extensive exploring.

So that’s what’s up with me.
