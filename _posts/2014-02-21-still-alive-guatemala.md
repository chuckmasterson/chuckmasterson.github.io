Forgive me if I’m a little irritable, but I thought I was smarter than
this. When I crossed into Mexico from Texas, the border guards didn’t
stamp my passport or anything.  Apparently they were supposed to, and since
they didn’t, I was going to have problems crossing the border. According
to the fast-talking guys who promised to get me through everything free
and clear, now that I was through the Mexican post, if I went back to them to
ask for a stamp, they would charge me a fine of $400 and detain me for five
days while they investigated me. Or I could pay this guy $180, and he would get
his friend in the office to give me an official stamp. Oh, I didn’t have
$180? How abut $50 US and 100 Guatemalan quetzales ($14). Still a bit
much? All right, they can do it for 500 Mexican pesos ($40). I should have just
gone back and risked the detention and the fine, which I am now positive were
entirely imaginary. But I paid the 500 pesos, and then Q100 for a cab, and
another Q100 for a “tip” before he’d give back my passport,
and then they finally quit bothering me and the cab took me to Malacatán. The
result being that I’m in Guatemala, in a possibly legal way, and I
don’t know what they’ll say when I go to cross through Belize to
get back to Mexico, but either way I’m out what equates to $68 US or my
budget for about a week and a half. I can replace the money, but that was going
to be useful money when I got back. My cushion of fall-back cash isn’t as
spongy as it once was. I’m angry tonight. Tomorrow I’ll probably be
okay.

Because one way or another, I’m going to lake
Atitlán.  It’s a big lake surrounded by about thirteen old Maya villages
with people still living the old-fashioned way and doing Maya things. And after
that, maybe I’ll climb a volcano. But to get you up to date: after
Teotihuacán, I took a three-day walk-and-hitch trip and met some extremely nice
people, and then I went to a beach and got myself good and roasted, and
now I’m here. I’m going to slow down a little bit now that
I’m here. I’ve been rushing around way too fast and never being in
the same place two nights in a row. Relaaaax.
