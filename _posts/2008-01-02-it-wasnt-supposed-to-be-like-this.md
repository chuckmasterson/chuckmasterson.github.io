*[Note from 2017: This is part of a series of posts I wrote after suddenly
discovering that religion can be questioned. I felt like I had broken into
uncharted territories of thought and needed to reveal the way to the sad
unenlightened. Drunk on this conviction, and still emotionally underdeveloped
following a very introverted childhood, I proceeded to become the most
condescending kind of atheist and also blindly wreak emotional havoc among the
Christian parts of my family. Thankfully this was a phase. My current thoughts
on religion are quite different, and at some point if I see fit to blog about
them, you'll be able to find them in the "religion" category here. I'm leaving
the posts up as a window into that ugly time.]*

Mom’s going through a nervous breakdown. She revealed to me this morning that
she hadn’t eaten for three days. I made her one of her microwave Jenny Craig
things, and she ate about half of it. She’s been crying all day long. She’s
really at a low spot; I’ve never seen her like this before. This wasn’t
supposed to happen. If I’d known -- if I’d even suspected -- I would never have
done it like this. Pray for her, if you will. Dad’s taking her to Christ
Hospital to get an IV, so she’ll have some nutrients in her. She says she’ll
probably call off work tomorrow. I really hope she gets better, and in a hurry.
I can’t stand to see her like this. Especially knowing that I started it all.

What have I done.

*[2017 again: She came back from the hospital later that night and soon started
eating again, and eventually was able to accept things the way they turned out
to be, with some help from the Quakers. I took far longer to get a clue.]*
