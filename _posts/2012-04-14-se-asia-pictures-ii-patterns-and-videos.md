#### Wat Rajbophit, Bangkok


{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 008.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 009.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 010.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 015.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 018.jpg" %}

#### Wat Pho, Bangkok

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 022.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 035.jpg" %}

#### Wat Arun, Bangkok

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 044.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 059.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 061.jpg" %}

_Zooming out #1:_ I took a close-up picture, and then one from farther away,
and so on until I got to the big picture. 

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 045.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 046.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 047.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 048.jpg" %}

*Zooming Out #2:*

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 049.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 050.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 051.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 052.jpg" %}

*Zooming Out #3:* 

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 054.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 053.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 055.jpg" %}

(This one isn’t actually from the same part of the temple, but the
pattern is analogous.) 

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 057.jpg" %}

*Zooming Out #4:*

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 070.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 065.jpg" %}

#### Temples of Chiang Mai

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 073.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 076.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 077.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 079.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 080.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 081.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 083.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 086.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 087.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 088.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 089.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 091.jpg" %}

#### A few from Luang Prabang

(The following two are the same door. I couldn’t get the whole thing in
frame from a good angle.)

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 136.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 137.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 138.jpg" %}

#### Wat Preah Prom Rath, Siem Reap

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 239.jpg" %}

And… 

#### Angkor Wat and associated temples

(There are other pictures of the bas-relief murals in the previous post. I
duplicated a few other pictures for this post from the last post, but I decided
that the murals are already a gray area between patterns and art, so I
shouldn’t really duplicate them. Hence why I don’t have many
pictures here from this engraved-everywhere place.)

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 269.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 271.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 277.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 278.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 307.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="SEAsia 315.jpg" %}

Also!

#### Chinese New Year celebration, Siem Reap

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQhN5CJoAEU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This was in a back alley in town. These guys were a wandering troupe of Chinese
New Year merrymakers, and apparently celebrated just wherever a celebration was
needed. The building they’re walking through in the video is a
restaurant, and after this they went to a massage place. I don’t know if
the business owners pay them to come and celebrate the new year, or if these
guys just go around and ask, “Hey, mind if we celebrate the new year in
your building?”

#### Video tour of Preah Khan (I think), Angkor Wat complex

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GujeLAPiB-g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It’s hard to get a feel for a place just from pictures. But a video can
make it feel a bit more like you’re actually there. Or at least I hope
so. The sudden pan to the left at the end was because the bird that you hear
was really loud in real life and I was trying to move the shot to where it
sounded like it was calling from.
