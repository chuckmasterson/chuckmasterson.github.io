merely boring and pointless.*

[...] Ah, and I’ve gotten a comment from
someone else who goes to Crowduck! It hadn’t occurred to me, actually, to
meet other people who go to Crowduck. When we’re there, the rest of the
people there are generally old guys on a Fishing Trip with the Guys, and we
normally don’t really socialize with the people in the other cabins, I
suppose because they look like they’ve got enough socializing amongst
themselves, and because we’ve also got quite enough to get on with with
our own large family. Plus we’re fishing a lot of the time. I did search
for Crowduck one time, but I just got this guy Sam Minter (who calls himself
Abulsme Noibatno Itramne -- obviously an anagram of “Samuel
‘Abobanation’ Minter”), and he didn’t go to the camp,
just somewhere near the lake. I’m intrigued. Where do you live? How much
stuff do you take? Because we always take way too much. What week are you going
this year? This is interesting!

[... An]other thing [that happened] is that just today, I biked up to Subway for an interview.
The interview went like this:

“I’m Sarah. Your name is?”

“[Chuck].”

“All right, [Chuck], I’m going to hire you.”

She then gave me a big old packet full of
written standards of how to work, and told me to come back at 0900 tomorrow
with it filled out. The packet is of varying degrees of coherence; toward the
lower end of the spectrum, you have things like this: “After the meats
you will then add to the bottom of the bread a generous portion of our
topping’s in which are routinely placed on each six-inch or footlong
sandwich, unless requested otherwise by the customer.” However, I could
make out almost all of it. I have a job! And about time, too! I plan to keep
this job, too. However, I do still need to confide to Sarah about the three
straight week’s in which are I’ll be gone (due to band camp and
then college visits plus Crowduck). I hope she understands, too. She
hasn’t, technically, hired me yet, I don’t think: just given me a
fat packet of stuff. Nevertheless, Mom’s taking me clothes shopping
tonight so I can get some black or kakhi [_sic_] pants with no pockets down the
side or shorts made of cotton or polyester or cotton/polyester blend that are
neatly tailored, which is what I need according to the book. In the meantime,
I’m hungry.
