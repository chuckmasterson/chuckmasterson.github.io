I’m back from the real trip, the one that went to an actual destination,
instead of Seymour, Indiana. I learned some more interesting lessons on this
one. Let’s see if I can remember them all, or at least the best ones. 

*   Tire pumps are not indestructible, nor, indeed, are they necessarily even
    very sturdy. One’s tire pump may choose to break in two pieces for no
    readily apparent reason. In this case it will be necessary to ride on
    poorly inflated tires to the nearest gas station to pump up, and then after
    the incident one will simply have to trust in the sturdiness of one’s tires
    until a new pump can be gotten.
*   Not overloading my homemade saddlebags causes them to work perfectly. When
    overloaded, they cause lots and lots of trouble. Minimalism wins again.
*   After biking throughout the daytime for three straight days, wearing a
    fleece jacket and sometimes a heavy coat, one can wipe the grime off one’s
    face in little globs.
*   It can get lonely being on a bike trip with no one to talk to. However, if
    I’m in a natural setting, loneliness usually means I’m not trying very hard
    to enjoy the moment, and I should consider where I am more. For example, I
    could try sitting in a forest in the night and listening. It might happen
    that a deer will wander around a few feet down the trail from me. In this
    case I will feel less alone, because nature is something that I’m a part
    of, it’s just that I have to remember that sometimes.
*   Google Maps is by no means to be unconditionally trusted. I had already
    learned this lesson, but I now know it harder. I was supposed to get on the
    Tri-County Triangle Trail outside Chillicothe, Ohio. To do this Google
    wanted me to go down Musselman Station Road. When I got to it, I discovered
    that Musselman Station Road is a one-lane gravel road that goes past some
    horses and sheep and then plummets for about a mile. When I got to the
    bottom of the street, there was no bike trail. Instead there was a river,
    which I couldn’t cross, especially not with my loaded-down bike and an
    abundance of NO TRESPASSING signs. Later the next morning, I found a map in
    a gas station that showed the trail. The problem was that I was on South
    Musselman Station Road, and the trail is only accessible from North
    Musselman Station Road. The two roads don’t touch. They could, easily, with
    a bridge—South deadends at the river, and the map shows North deadending
    directly opposite from it, give or take a field—but they don’t. So I had to
    push my bike all the way back up the road and take the highway.
*   A tarp laid underneath and then folded overtop of one’s sleeping bag can
    serve as an workable substitute for a tent, but presents the problem of
    letting dew and frost collect on one’s face and any uncovered belongings.

That should give you the general flavor of the trip. But since you’d
probably also like to know how it went in a chronological sort of fashion,
I’ll write about that too.

Day one: I got up early at home and ate, and then managed to get out of the
house and on the road by 8:30 in the morning, which impressed me. I biked out
of Cincinnati via Loveland and the Little Miami Scenic Trail. Looking at my
directions, I decided that Greenfield, Ohio, would make a good goal for the
day. At 69 miles away, it was a good distance, somewhat over a quarter of the
250 miles I was going to be covering in four days. The road was flat most of
the way there. Following Ethan’s meal plan for bike trips—eat simple
bagels and peanut butter for breakfast, something from a restaurant for lunch,
and a cooked-out meal for dinner—I stopped in Blanchester at lunchtime and ate
an entire 12-inch pepperoni pizza that I got for just four dollars. Continuing,
I headed on toward Greenfield. And I made it there at about 2:30. What else was
there for it but to keep going? So I went to Chillicothe, making it about 83
miles. Getting past the Musselman Station scandal, I got there an hour or so
before dark and found a park next to a disconnected part of the Tri-County
Triangle Trail. I set up camp there a little ways away from a creek, in low
ground, behind some tufts of dead tall grass. I cooked some fairly tasty fancy
ramen noodles. Then I went to bed.

Day two: I got up and, despite forecasts that had warned me of rain, it was
only misty. I ate my bagels and packed up my stuff and got going. That was when
it started raining, but it wasn’t bad—just a drizzle. I didn’t even
pull out my raincoat. But I did bike a little slower. I still covered about a
day’s worth of biking, but no more. For lunch I stopped in a little
carry-out place called Nichol’s. It was tiny, barely big enough to walk
in and with no seating, but it had apparently been operating for four
generations there. I saw at least two of those generations—the couple running
it, and one of their moms, who was sitting in the front watching a TV barely as
far away from her as the end of her legs. I got a meatball sub, because Mr
Nichols said the meatballs were good, and also a “pizza bun”—pizza
toppings on a hamburger bun, one dollar. Then I ate it sitting on their bench
out front, watching their somewhat shy cat. Mrs Nichols came out a little later
and asked about my journey, and when I told her my destination, she seemed
impressed. I pulled into Athens and found another bike trail. It’s twenty
miles long, but I only joined it in time to use the last two. I aimed for a
park outside town, Strouds Run. But when I found the trail that led there, it
said I had three miles to travel, and it was kind of steep. So I crashed for
the night in a hilly field, separated from the subdivision I had come through
by a construction site and a very big pile of dirt. That was the night when I
sat in the forest and heard the deer. I left my hat where I was sitting, and
didn’t realize this until I went to sleep. At that point I had to get out
of my warm sleeping bag and trek all the way back up the trail to get it.

Day three: I’ll put in my journal entry for this one, because I think
it’s one of my better ones lately.

After I wrote the entry, I went for a walk and then to sleep. While I was in
the sack, a chorus of coyotes burst out around me. They sounded like they were
on all sides of me. I was amazed, but also slept with my knife out.

Day four: I got up and it was even colder than the previous morning. I was out
in the shade of all the hills now, and the landscape hadn’t thawed yet by
the time I got rolling, which was a first for the trip and required me to
defrost my bike seat. Everything melted while I was reading a trail signboard
at the trailhead in Walker, West Virginia. I turned away from it and there were
liquids again. I rode on and eventually came to the first of many tunnels for
the day. Not far into it, the light disappeared. I could still see the light at
the end of the tunnel, but around me it was totally black and the walls were
invisible. Drifting through, with no footsteps to bounce me up and down, and
unable to see my body or anything but the light ahead, I felt like a
disembodied head. Who needs drugs when you’ve got tunnels? There were
eleven of them that day, I believe. The last one was the longest, and came just
before West Union, which was where I left the trail and followed a blacktop
road to Nana & Papaw’s house. I hadn’t been down this way since I
came to college, and I was grinning and whistling in my head the whole way,
recognizing things I hadn’t seen in years. After ten miles, I finally
pulled around the last bend and pedaled right up the long driveway, past Nana &
Papaw, and put the bike in the garage, where Papaw tied it up so it
wouldn’t fall over. The trip was done. Now it was time for Thanksgiving.
I got in the mood by eating lots and lots of chicken noodle soup for dinner. I
had arrived.

The big idea behind coming to West Virginia, besides Thanksgiving, was the deer
hunt. Starting when the season opened on Monday, we had three and a half days
to find a deer—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thanksgiving morning. The first
two of these days, we hiked up into the wilds of Nana & Papaw’s hill and
stayed there all day, but to no avail. The closest we came was at the very
beginning, when we summited the rise to get to the flat area where the biggest
cabin sits, and Micah saw three deer, far off behind too many trees for a shot,
and they quickly left. Other than that, it was just me and Micah sitting in the
cabin, looking out into the 360 degrees of forest enveloping us. I could think
of many worse ways to spend a day. Though we didn’t see deer, I learned
the forest’s daily routine, more or less. Like how all the squirrels come
out an hour after dawn and an hour before dusk and scamper around making all
the noise they can. On Monday night Micah and I actually slept in the cabin, so
as to be up at dawn to see the deer moving, but it rained the next morning, and
that causes deer to lie down and stay put. No deer, but it was a delightful
warm morning anyhow, and we collected hickory nuts.

On the third day, Dad, the master of the hunt, stationed me where he had put me
yesterday afternoon, on a knob with a commanding view of two valleys and a
broad expanse of hilly land. I listened to squirrels all morning. Around 11:00,
I saw some deer, but two of them were too small, and the other one was too
quick to head up the hill and over the ridge. But, unluckily for the deer, up
the hill was where Dad had positioned himself. I heard a shot. For a while
nothing happened, so I just kept watching for deer. I saw one, actually, though
it was too far away, and barely appeared over the ridge before it walked back
over the same ridge and disappeared. Then Dad came down and said, “Hey.
Did you see it?”

He had hit the deer. I told him I’d seen one, perhaps the same one, head
south. He figured the one I’d seen couldn’t be the one he’d
hit, if it was walking calmly like I described. His had run erratically
downward from him. He looked around near where he had hit it, and found a blood
splatter. “You see how foamy this blood is? That’s a lung
shot.”

He trailed it away from the blood splatter, northward. I headed south, not
following the blood, just looking for a wounded deer. Over the next rise, I saw
a deer, but it didn’t appear any too wounded, because it got up and ran
away from me. Still, though, it didn’t run out of sight, so I ran after
it. The next time it was slower about getting away from me, and then I finally
found it lying down next to a stump. From twenty yards away over a valley, I
took aim with the gun Dad had given me, and stopped the deer from running any
more. Then I walked over to her. She was sputtering from the lung shot, lying
there, apparently knowing her time had come. I chambered another round and
aimed, and took a point-blank shot. She died.

Now here I was, with what used to be a deer, and not knowing what to do with
it. I yelled for Dad, but he was several valleys away, out of sight. After a
time he came back from following the blood trail the wrong way, and showed me
how to field-dress a deer. After we took most of her guts out, we trussed her
up on a dead sapling by her feet and started carrying her. Uphill, Dad said,
was the correct way to go to get back to the house, so we carried her that way.
But we quickly discovered that she was very intent on remaining a body at rest.
Getting her up to the top of the hill, in all the slippery leaves, was proving
to be just short of impossible. We took frequent breaks, during which I would
check out the terrain just ahead. When we got near the top, I went up to it to
see which way to turn. But this was a ridge we had never crossed, adorned with
a barbed-wire fence and an ATV trail. Dad came up to examine the situation, and
pointed us in a way that seemed to me the exact opposite of where we should be
going. He walked that way and tried to find the cabin, but it wasn’t
there. So he tried going off in a perpendicular direction. Nothing there
either, and I soon found out why: the cabin was where *I* thought it
should be, to the north. I showed it to him, and he said, “How’d it
get there?!” Then he resolved to follow the ATV trail to the house while
I waited and bring back his truck so we wouldn’t have to carry it.

That seemed to me like cheating. I guess fate thought so too, because he came
back not with his truck but with Micah. The three of us took turns carrying the
deer, two at a time, in the direction I’d had in mind the whole time. It
was up and down all the way to the cabin, and even such brawny men as us
required breaks every minute or two. But once we got her to the cabin, there
was a trail that was clear and downhill the whole way, so we got her back in no
time from there. We untied her, and Papaw took her off to a butchering place.
Then we collapsed into chairs and ate big meals.

The next day was Thanksgiving. I finally appreciated this family-reunion-style
Thanksgiving for the first time. I learned a lot: for example, I had no idea
that Papaw had seven siblings. I talked to one of them, Jon, about his days of
hopping trains from town to town on the same route that had been turned into
the North Bend Rail Trail. He also told me about Clay, an ancestor of ours who
was so good at trainhopping around the time of the Depression that B&O offered
him a job, which he held down for decades. I talked to a lot of other people,
too. But most of it doesn’t make for anything interesting to read here.

So, lastly, I want to put down some reflections I’ve had on wilderness
skills since spending a little time outdoors. My beef a while ago with some of
the books I’d read about primitive skills was that they had a focus on
wilderness *survival*, and tended to pretty much ignore the possibility of
wilderness *living*. They were written for the person who thinks
there’s a possibility that he’ll get marooned in the wilderness and
need to survive long enough to get rescued. That sort of thing really happens
to very few people. What I was looking for more was a book of ways to live off
the land, in the wilderness, for the long term. Now I’ve begun to think
more about something that I always knew, but didn’t really think about
much: preindustrial people didn’t live right out in the wilderness. They
lived in houses and shelters that they built. The primitive skills they knew
weren’t the ones that you might think of when you think of survivalism,
and they’re not the ones that a lot of places teach. They were more along
the lines of how to find wild food plants, how to preserve those foods, how to
hunt animals and preserve that also, and how to keep a nice home to live in.
These are things that I’ll have to learn by doing for a long time. And I
wonder to what extent they can really be taught. If I wanted to teach people
wild living skills, I could teach them the basic, survivalist-type skills, like
making fire with a bow-drill, knapping flint tools, and such, and that will
equip them to stay alive for a little while—but people who know this stuff and
nothing beyond it are people who will soon return to civilization after their
he-man little outing in the woods. Or I could try to teach them how to really
live off the land, with those skills that I mentioned before: food
preservation, identifying wild plants, hunting game. But, to take just the
example of wild plants, teaching this in any way that would help a person out
in living off the land would require me to show them dozens of plants, what
parts of them are available in what seasons, and if I wanted to really help
them out, how to cook with these plants. That can’t be covered in a
weekend class, or in a week-long one. You’d really want a year, to see
all the different seasons. But that’s not practicable. So, if I want to
teach (after thoroughly learning for myself) wilderness skills, what do I do?
Teach what I can in limited amounts of time? Teach the little skills with
cool-factor like firebuilding? Or perhaps I would go a completely different
direction with it. I could live in an ecovillage and learn these sorts of
skills from other people while also teaching whatever I know for myself. Or I
could make a homestead of my own, learn stuff by experience, and then teach it
to my child or children.

The trouble with the last two is that they don’t earn money. I wrote in a
previous entry that I thought the career for me is in teaching wilderness
skills. Now I’m having trouble even deciding what wilderness skills
mean—in two senses of the word: what the words “wilderness skills”
refer to, and what wilderness skills mean to me. But I’m going to stop
there for now and come back later with a post that has thoughts about wage
labor, time, and also the meaning of life. Things are complicated. But I feel
like I can eventually understand a lot of them, even though I’ll never
understand them all.
