Lately it seems like when I think about things, they fall into lists.
Don’t know why that is. Maybe it’s a consequence of too much
internet use. Everyone knows the internet thinks in lists: “The 41
Funniest Cat GIFs of 2013”, “16 More Pictures You Won’t
Believe Aren’t Photoshopped”, “5 Ridiculous Things You
Probably Believe about Islam”, “29 Awesome Things about Being
29”. If that’s the cause, one of these lists addresses it.
Meanwhile, though, here are some lists. 

Occasionally I have strong opinions for no particular reason. This is a short
list of things I will never do, compiled while I was on Facebook: 

*   Selfies
*   Bitstrips
*   Twitter
*   Check-ins
*   Resharing
*   Clicking the “Like” button because I’m asked to

This next list is probably the one that gets the most running time in my head.
I’ve been on the road for a long time, and there are a lot of things
I’ve had to defer until such time as I have a stable base of my own.
It’s going to be really nice when I move into a place that’s my own
and that doesn’t keep moving, and this is a list of things I’m
looking forward to doing when I’m in that place. 

* Writing (fiction and probably a summary of my traveling).
* Going paleo. I’ll finally be able to do all my own cooking and get good
  quality food for myself. 
* Parkour. Minneapolis has a parkour crew!
* Camping a lot. Grinnell has a thing that’s sort of like “what if Facebook
  looked like Reddit and were restricted to Grinnell students, alums, and
  professors”, and on it I found a girl who lives in Minneapolis and has a goal
  of visiting two thirds of Minnesota’s state parks and would like someone to
  camp with her. The cosmos clearly had me in mind when they caused her to
  write that.
* Rock climbing at some of those parks, hopefully.
* Practicing calligraphy. I’m a good draftsman but not outstanding with a
  calligraphic nib, which makes the most fluid and natural shapes.
* Drawing stuff. 
* Making a Mongolian _deel_.

  met in Mongolia. The one on the right is wearing a *deel*." %}

  I thought these were pretty much the greatest thing when I went to Mongolia.
  I put one on on a cold night while I was visiting some nomads, and it was all
  of a sudden as if temperatures didn’t exist. I’ve been in touch
  with a girl studying in Mongolia, and she says it’s probably cotton
  outside, wool in the middle, and fur on the inside for a winter *deel*.
  Doesn’t that sound like the warmest thing ever? I’ll probably tan
  my own deer hide for it, since that’s something I’d like to learn
  how to do. 

* Gardening. I’ve got those _kkaennip_ seeds, after all.
* Going to permaculture meetups.
* Proofreading in free time, via a website I learned about in Vancouver called
  Elance (think “freelance”). 
* Perhaps acting in some small-time plays. I’ve often thought that would be
  fun.
* Learning guitar and/or banjo. It’s about time I learned to play a real
  instrument. (I guess I could play a trumpet if pressed, but trumpeting isn’t
  much appreciated around a campfire or in a living room, and I haven’t played
  a song in about six years.)
* And with all this stuff going on, I’ll have a lot less time to read stupid
  stuff on the internet, so I’ll also stop doing that.

Related to that list: I made a tactical mistake. In my Christmas list blog I
put up just a few things, mainly because I knew there were some things I would
actually need for living on my own, but I decided I shouldn’t ask for
them just then, because I wouldn’t use them until springtime anyway, and
by then it would be my birthday and I’d be able to ask for them at a more
topical time. But then I started listing the things I’ll want, and
realized that it’s kind of a lot to expect of a birthday. Maybe we can
say it’s a special birthday because it’s combined with me finally
going out to live on my own. In any case, this is my birthday list.


*   A bike. I super-duper loved my Fuji Crosstown, which is a hybrid (which
    means it’s sort of halfway between a mountain bike and a street bike), but
    when I was in Korea someone left it outside of Dad’s garage and it got
    rained on for a year and a half, and it was already having a little bit of
    trouble where the handlebar connected to the front post. I think I need a
    new hybrid bike.
*   Cookware.
*   _Yerba mate_ paraphernalia: a thermos and a good _bombilla_. The _bombilla_
    is the straw with the filter at the bottom, but the only _bombillas_ I’ve
    used are kinda crappy and let a lot of leaves through, rendering the _mate_
    a bit chewy. A gourd would also be a nice touch but could also make me look
    a bit silly.
*   Parkour shoes?
*   Rock climbing gear? I might want to put that off until a future birthday
    when I know how much rock climbing I’ll be doing. I might already have all
    I need, since I have a pair of climbing shoes.
*   _The Natural Way to Draw_, apparently the book that Annie Dillard, one of
    my favorite authors, learned how to draw from.

This is a list of all the languages I can count to ten in.

> English, Spanish, French, Italian, Mongolian, Korean (two ways), Mandarin,
> Navajo, Russian, Finnish, Welsh, Hungarian, Nepali, Japanese, Khmer,
> Esperanto, German

This is a list of town names in the US that are pronounced all wrong.

*   La Plata, Missouri: “luh _play-_tuh”
*   Cairo, Missouri: “_kay_-roh”
*   Versailles, Indiana: “vur-_sayles_“
*   El Dorado, Ohio: “ell duh-_ray_-doh”
*   Nevada, Missouri: “neh-_vay-_duh”
*   New Madrid, Missouri: “new _mad-_rid”
*   Hayti, Missouri: “hay-tie”
*   Detroit, Michigan: the French would say “deh-_trwa_“
*   Limon, Colorado: “_lie_-mun” (comes from Spanish _limón_, pronounced
    “lee-_mohn_“)
*   Lima, Ohio: “_lie_-muh” (in Spanish, “_lee_-mah”)
*   Belle Fourche, South Dakota: “bell fooosh”
*   San Rafael, California: “san ruh-_fell_“
*   New Orleans, Louisiana: the French would say “or-leh-_awn_“
*   Los Angeles, California: The way we say “los” sounds like Spanish “las”,
    which makes all the angels female
*   Arab, Ohio: “_ay_-rab”
*   St Croix Falls, Wisconsin: “saint croy falls”
*   Pekin, Illinois: “_peek_-in” (nowadays the original Pekin is pronounced
    “Beijing”, though that’s because the Chinese pronunciation has changed
    since the old days—but it was never pronounced like _peekin’_.)
*   Des Moines, Iowa: “dee _moin_“
*   Pierre, South Dakota: “peer”
*   Natchitoches, Louisiana: “_nack-_a-dish”

Lastly, and this isn’t a list: if I ran a barber shop, I would get a
liquor license and make booze available to people waiting or getting their hair
cut, and then I would call the place “Coif and Quaff”.
