that I feel like a real snakekeeper. I’d been suspecting that maybe Tenzing
shedded without my noticing, because he didn’t look all dull anymore. So last
night I took out one of the frozen pinkie mice I bought in Davenport, and
warmed it up by hand. (It ended up sticky to the touch, which I wasn’t
expecting.) Aaron was sleeping, so I opened the cage lid quietly. No sooner had
I bumped Tenzing’s nose with the mouse than he took it instantly and silently
(only making a sound as he fell to the floor with it). I sat and watched him
swallow it, although I could barely see either of them. Within a few minutes,
he had gotten it down his throat and gone back to wandering around the cage
like he usually does at night. As of now he’s sitting on his branch under his
hide, digesting. Next week I’ll take a video of him striking and post it so you
all can watch. It’s pretty awesome.  

Other stuff: classes are going fine. I think I like all of my classes this
semester. I’ve only had a couple sessions of each, of course, but they seem
pretty good. (For reference, they’re intros to sociology and anthropology,
Spanish 217, and English Trads. 1 -- that is, early English literature. In that
one we’ll be reading stuff like _Beowulf_, _The Faerie Queene_, and such.)  

And Aaron just a few minutes ago told me that several people from college
frequent my blog, like a guy named Matt downstairs. Well if you read, by all
means you don’t need to keep it a secret. Leave a comment if you want. I kinda
like knowing who’s reading what I write.
