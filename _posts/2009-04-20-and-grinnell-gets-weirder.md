So, my plan for next year was to live at EcoHouse in the spring and some dorm
in the fall. I needed someone to switch out the room with -- so that I’d be
living in it in the fall and they’d be there in the spring. When I sent out an
email to all the people going abroad in the fall, I got a letter back from the
organizers of Food House, a project house like EcoHouse but devoted to food
(cooking it, getting it locally, growing it) instead of ecology. They needed
one extra person in the fall. So I agreed to that. However, the project houses
hadn’t presented their proposals to Housinge yet at this point. When Food House
did that, they didn’t get the 12-person house they wanted, but rather the
7-person house. I volunteered to be cut, because shortly before that, I had
gotten an email from an EcoHouse person who had just gotten an internship that
would extend from summer into the fall and leave a vacancy in EcoHouse in the
fall. I offered to fill this vacancy. The interesting part is that that means
I’m living with the person who would’ve been her roommate, Elissa.  

This is possible because this year Grinnell decided to make some areas of
campus gender-neutral, and all the project houses are included because they
only have one bathroom per floor. Gender-neutral means they don’t ask the
genders of the people applying to these rooms. It’s meant to accommodate people
who choose not to identify as either of the two widely accepted genders, but it
also means that in project houses we’re free to do pretty much whatever we
please regarding rooommates. She and I are both cool with the whole thing. She
sent me an email asking if I would have problems with various things, such as
clothes strewn about, and I didn’t, and she had no problems with any of the
things I came up with that I might be liable to do, such as strew clothes about
and have a pretty large snake cage. We’ve got a double with bunct beds and
windows facing west and south for lots of sun. We both agree that it’ll be fun
and interesting.
