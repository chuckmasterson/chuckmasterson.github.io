A few months ago, I found myself with a sudden longing to get a little truck. It was a surprise to
me too. I haven’t had a motor vehicle to call my own since 2016 when I got rid of a Mustang kicked
down to me after a brief midlife crisis my father had, by selling it to a dissolute character
I found on Craigslist. I lived in a city and didn’t need it; my bicycle was plenty. Then I traveled
nomadically for two years, and for that time shoe leather, my thumb, and freight trains got me
everywhere I wanted to go. And when I moved up to northern Wisconsin, I found I rarely felt
compelled to move anything besides my own person and the occasional load of groceries from place to
place, and I could accomplish it all by bike and bus.

(I waited long enough, in fact, that before ever considering owning another car, I had managed to
hear the end of the Mustang’s story. One day I got a letter from a junkyard in Alabama, asking if
I owned the below-named vehicle. I called them up and confirmed with the friendly, down-home woman
who answered that yes, I had once had a green Mustang, but I had sold it years ago. She explained
that it was white now, and had been languishing in their lot since getting confiscated during an
armed robbery a month prior. It had South Carolina plates, but South Carolina didn’t know any legal
owner, and referred her to West Virginia, where it had also never been registered legally. They told
her to check Minnesota, where it turned out I was the last one to legitimately hold a title on the
car. I could even have it back, if I cared to pay $6,700 in garaging fees. Tempting though this
sounded, she and I agreed that it was probably better if I let them scrap it.)

Partly this new longing for a pickup was because I had just inflamed my imagination with a wonderful
book called *The Hand-Sculpted House*, which is about building with cob. Cob (deriving from a Welsh
word for “lump”) is a building material not much in use anymore, but which formerly made up
a sizeable number of the houses in the British Isles, as well as places further flung, like Yemen.
It’s a mixture of sand, clay to hold it together, and straw to give the whole deal tensile strength.
Houses built of it have been standing in England for five hundred years. You can build a house out
of cob for a few percent of what it costs to make a stud-frame house with a process much friendlier
to beginner mistakes. The house you get is more energy-efficient and begs to be made into nice curvy
shapes rather than the boxes you get when you build with lumber. The pictures in the center of the
book made me seize paper and start dreaming up floor plans for a house Misty and I could live in.

One shortcoming of cob mentioned in the book is that it does poorly in places where the weather gets
seriously cold. The winters up here, where it hits –20° pretty reliably a few nights each year,
certainly qualify, but the authors also mentioned that people were currently at work on solving that
very problem, and twenty years had passed since the book was published, so I allowed my hopes to
fly, tempered with the knowledge that I was riding high on an initial wave of excitement and also
what I hoped to do may not in fact be possible.

But, I reasoned, if I ever wanted to build with cob, or if I ever wanted to build a house of any
sort, which I certainly did, I would need a truck. Something to haul sand and clay and big heavy
door lintel beams and all those things that excited me when I imagined them.

And come to think of it, I realized, I was starting to get tired of having such limited
effectiveness in the world. With my bike I could get myself from place to place, and I could carry
lightweight things from place to place, like ideas and words and friendships. And a life spent
moving nothing heavier than those could certainly be interesting and worth living. But I was
starting to yearn to change the world not just in the realm of ideas but *physically* too. I’d been
reading Wendell Berry and I’d just planted one of my first real gardens. I wanted to get my hands
dirty. I wanted to stop being exclusively a gadabout and flâneur, and open up the possibility of
becoming a *homesteader*. 

An earlier version of myself may have judged a truck to be an unacceptable capitulation to the
dominant system. I may have proclaimed confidently that I would never settle for anything that
emitted any more CO<sub>2</sub> than a horse. The current me is still somewhat conflicted on that
point, but has, it appears, come down on the side of wanting a truck. I will still be pleased,
though, if in a decade or two my main methods of transportation are bicycle and
horse-and-buggy.

It’s just that it takes energy to swim against the current. Right now, the world around me is set up
for cars. The roads teem with other cars; on Highway 13, part of my only practical route to most
places I need to go, it’s certainly *legal* to drive a horse, but the speed limit of 55 <span
class="smcp">mph</span> and the tight curves mean the buggy would probably become splintered
firewood within a month, and probably the driver with it. Nor are there hostlers or hitching posts
handy in these towns anymore. The bike is more practical around here than a horse, but even
a serious heavy-duty bike trailer only makes up some of the ground between it and a truck or
a buggy. For one, a bike turns sixty miles into a day rather than an hour, and the distance to good
jobs and good foods is harder to close these days than it was before cars showed up, small family
farms began disintegrating, and the railroads all pulled up their tracks. And for another, biking is
mostly solitary, since Misty, who I’d mostly be riding with, isn’t the kind of endurance rider I am.
(Though I may be able to get a tandem into our lives one of these days.)

Anyway, I’m hopeful that eventually I can learn to do enough good for the biosphere with a truck
that I partially offset, or even outweigh, how much I use it. That may be wishful thinking, since
gasoline really is a powerful force for environmental havoc. But if it turns out I like building
with cob, a little truck may be just what I need to start up a business building cob houses for
people around the region.

All of which is to say, I found a truck, and Misty and I agreed it looked like a good one, and we
bought it. My more purist self may at least be mollified to know that it’s a small, old one, a ’98
Ford Ranger, with only 135,000 miles, likely to last years with good treatment. We got it from a guy
who painted my former landlady’s mom’s house once. He sold it to us for a sweetheart price and threw
in an extra set of wheels for free. When we don’t just call it “the truck”, we call it Blondie.

This truck represents the first time *I’ve* really decided to be an automobile owner, and I’ve
noticed an interesting contrast between now and the past couple cars I’ve ended up owning just by
circumstance. With Blondie, I actually care about maintenance. Up until the last couple months,
I had an almost gut aversion to doing anything under the hood of a car. I could fill the gas and, in
a pinch, add oil. But beyond that, I filed car knowledge under “stuff car people care about”.
I wasn’t a car person, so I ignored it. There may have been a touch of smugness underlying that
ignoring: “I wouldn’t know that---I don’t deal with those terrible machines.” The same kind of
smugness an evangelical vegan has about not knowing how to cook meat.

This past week, I changed the leaf springs in Blondie. The guy who sold it to us warned us that
those would need to be changed. “It’s super easy,” he said, “you just get the new one and slip it in
there.” I nodded but thought to myself, “No way that’s easy.” I finally got around to having some
new springs cut, at a place over in Duluth, and then set about putting them on. The guys at Duluth
Superior Spring assured me it was really simple to put on the new spring. “You just cut through
those bolts, and slide it in, and hammer down that bracket, and bolt it all back together.” I could
already tell it was going to be a nightmare.

But I borrowed a jack from our landlord, and got out my hacksaw and hammer and the rest, and got to
it anyhow. And, well, it *was* awful. One of the wheels wouldn’t come off at the beginning until
I kicked it about twenty times, hard. I had eight bolts to saw through, and not one of them was in
a place that gave me enough elbow room to really saw. The hacksaw and the electric saw both jammed
up all the time. The first bolt on either side more or less exploded apart when I got it cut
through, which was pretty disconcerting. Until I understood which way all the forces were balanced,
I proceeded at arm’s length and with my eyes squinted, convinced that at any moment the spring
tension in the leaf springs would recoil and send bolt fragments everywhere. I got exhausted from
sawing, exhausted differently from maneuvering heavy chunks of metal, and covered in grease up to my
elbows. The car was up on blocks for three days and two nights, and for half that time I remained
convinced that I’d either damage the car beyond repair or get in way beyond my depth and have to
find some car whiz to bail me out.

But I got it done. And when I did, I felt a sense of real accomplishment. I have a tool, and I know
how to maintain it. And that makes me feel in control. The other cars I’ve had have been something
like adversaries: I work with them for as long as they see fit to keep working, but at any point
they could break down, and cost me hundreds of dollars, just at their whim. I treated them with
suspicion and mostly dealt with their problems by ignoring them, indeed ignoring the whole car. (I
barely used either of them. Misty knew me for most of a year before finding out I had the Mustang,
because I had lent it long-term to a friend. The other, a Civic, I had barely any relation to aside
from being on the title.) With Blondie, though, I’m taking a different tack. I’m treating this
useful thing with respect, keeping it clean, keeping it in good order. I changed the oil the other
day, and the air filter too. I’m learning how it works so that if it breaks down I’m not just at the
mercy of car nerds, I can actually do something.

In return, I’ve been able to accomplish some cool stuff. I’ve moved house for me and Misty. I’ve
hauled some firewood---admittedly, only about a ninth of what we have out front of our house right
now, the rest of it having come in the trucks of people we know who actually have chainsaws. I’ve
carried a canoe to a wild rice lake and gone ricing. And hopefully sometime soon I’ll even be able
to build a new house with its help.

The essential thing is to own the tool, not be owned by it. A truck I understand and can work on is
a truck I own. A truck that does things I can’t predict and can’t fix is a truck that owns me.

Does that mean I’m going to become a gearhead? Not likely. I might not even make it to the top half
of people I know, in terms of car knowledge. However carefully maintained, any car is
inherently going to spew greenhouse gases,[^tes] and that knowledge will always temper any
enthusiasm I have for things automotive. But what’s important, here, is that I’m the one in control,
because I won’t give up my power. I can change a leaf spring: nothing can stop me.

[^tes]: Yes, even a Tesla: it just spews them at the power plant instead.
