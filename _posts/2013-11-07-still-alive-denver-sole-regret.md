I hitched from Indio, California, to Denver. The whole time I was trying to
escape the time zone I was in, but it followed me everywhere I went. First I
crossed into Arizona and into Mountain Time. But Arizona is the one state that
ignores Daylight Saving Time, so it’s on Mountain Standard, which is the
same as the Pacific Daylight I was just coming from. After two or three days I
figured that out. But by then I was just about out of Arizona and into
Colorado, where I could finally set my watch ahead an hour. Only, of course,
the day that I entered Colorado was the same day that Daylight Saving ended, so
I crossed the Arizona Exception Boundary right back into Mountain Standard. Now
I have to wait until Nebraska (or Kansas) before I can change my watch.
Actually, though, according to a rumor that I just made up, those states both
had measures on the ballot yesterday that got them added to Mountain Time, and
Missouri boldly decided to institute Reverse Daylight Saving Time (a.k.a.
Daylight Squandering Time) to boost their economy with the dollars of all the
tourists who will come to watch groggy drivers crash and skid around comically.

Denver’s nice. It has a mild oxygen shortage, but that doesn’t seem
to faze most of the people who live there. Today I went to the Federal
Reserve’s Money Museum and picked up approximately $165 worth of shredded
unfit bills for free. I also complained both there and at the Mint about the
dramatically slackening standards of design in American currency. I mean, the
new pennies use Myriad, a sycophantic font designed specifically to be mediocre
and unremarkable (like most of what Adobe’s pet designer Robert Slimbach
does). The new presidential dollar coins use Benguiat and Goudy Old Style (both
decent fonts for other purposes, but hideous on a coin) and, around the edge
-- the ultimate insult -- motherfucking *Arial*. Half of new American
coinage looks like hastily designed bathroom tokens. Time used to be that being
an engraver meant knowing how to engrave something as elementary as the
alphabet, and each coin was created with absolutely purpose-designed lettering,
as it should be, as befits a tradition that was kick-started by the
inscriptions on Emperor Trajan’s column in Rome, known as perhaps the
finest lettering in history. Coins used to be art. *Art, damn it!!*

So anyhow, the other thing I wanted to let you all know was that if I have one
single regret about my travels, it’s that I didn’t see
[this](http://imgur.com/gallery/D9iDC) before I started planning it all. That’s
all.
