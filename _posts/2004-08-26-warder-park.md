In my journal last night, I tried to draw a map of Warder Park. In accordance with what I wrote here last night--that it’s “kvazaŭa ovalo”, or “kind of an oval”, I drew it as an oval with one right angle. But when I went to draw in the rest of my general area, nothing fit. So I went online to check on what it _really_ looks like. And what I found is [TopoZone.com](http://www.topozone.com/). I believe what they have done is mapped out the entire world, in minute detail, and published it for your viewing convenience. I live in Finneytown, a suburb of Cincinnati, and I never even knew some of the things that they displayed there. They know Finneytown better than I do, and I’ve _lived_ here (regrettably) for twelve years. First I found out what Warder Park really does look like. (I’m not going to describe it here, though, because you can just look at the map of it at TopoZone.) And then I noticed the little wash that comes out of Burke’s Pond (that’s what the little pond there is called). I followed it down through North Hill to where I realized it’s part of the creek I usually creekwalk at. And then I followed it further, further than I’ve ever creekwalked. Past View Place Drive. Past the Cincinnati City Limits. Into Mill Creek, upstream to the railroad track.

I love railroad tracks. When I saw the railroad, I realized that this was the event I needed to put a bang at the end of my summer. School starts in four days, only three of which count[^1], so I’ve got to savor things while they last. And I plan to use up one of the three that count by taking an all-day hike to the railroad tracks at Mill Creek. This will be incredibly great. I’ll take my backpack, pack it full of Gatorades and lunches and stuff, set off down the creek, and not come back for twelve hours. The perfect end to my vacation.

I’m losing my audience, it seems. Either that, or everyone who reads this is really quiet. Matt, are you there? Virgi? Aaron? Leah? Come on, guys, I need feedback! Let me know: do you want more funny? Or more other? Or what? I’m getting lonely here!

Today’s Curiosity (brought to you by Gooperton Rubber Membranes, Inc.):

Can you think of a word

:with a ch pronounced like a k;

:with a ph pronounced like a p;

:with an sh pronounced like an s;

:with a th pronounced like a t?

Things to remember:

(1) The required letters don’t by any means need to be at the beginning of the word--most of them aren’t. (2) There is more than one answer to every single one of them. (3) And these are all English words--just when you thought you had come up with a loophole, huh?

Answers to be posted when you all get fed up. If you have an answer you want checked, post it under comments. If you don’t have the answer and you see someone has left a comment, don’t look at the comments. If you do you’ll just feel like a cheater. There’s no prize, but you do get to pat yourself on the back if you figure it out.

[^1]: Tomorrow doesn’t count, because I’ve got band practice.
