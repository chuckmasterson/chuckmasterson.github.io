I've been trying to haiku more, the last few days. It makes me pay attention.

* * *

I worked on a farm for three days in a town called Pillager:

soft rain on the field  
drops placed with care, one by one  
on cranberry flowers
{: .poetry .text-center }

* * *

little black birds make  
sounds like ecstatic water  
while I weed the peas
{: .poetry .text-center }

* * *

I rode north from there along the Paul Bunyan Trail, longest paved rail-trail in the country.

stop to meet a lake  
soon -- covered with tickling flies  
and caterpillars
{: .poetry .text-center }

paved trail: jutting backbone  
to either side, the bogs creak --  
bust open with frogsong
{: .poetry .text-center }

* * *

Then, today, it was rainy.

the musk of wet ferns  
welcomed the first fish aground.
flower smells quenched today
{: .poetry .text-center }

* * *

I'm now all out of bike trail. The rest of the way, wherever that is, will be via roads. Up here most of them are lazy ones, broad-shouldered, quiet, through vivid green and blue, white stands of popple trunks, red-winged blackbirds singing leisurely songs and shuffling with papery noises through last year's cattails.
