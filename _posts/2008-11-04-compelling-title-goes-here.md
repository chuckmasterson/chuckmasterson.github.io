I finished break, unfortunately, and drove on back to Iowa. The next day, I
discovered I was going to have one heck of a week. I was more or less
continually working the whole week, and getting to bed around 0300 or 0400. Im
short, it was pretty awful. The only upside was that it made the weekend *so*
much better by contrast. Stuff I did included: a sociology report where I went
into the Walmart in town, a lot of reading for Spanish and a lot more than that
for English, and reading a whole book for anthropology. I also worked with
Press some. We’re working hard on getting all our books in publishable
shape. And on Friday night I worked at Bob’s Underground Café.  

The weekend was much better. On Saturday, I went on a trackwalk with a friend I
found a while ago named James Y. We were both looking for edible plants by the
railroad north of college when we first met. So, that tells you a little bit
about both of us. James told me he’d found a way to CERA via the
railroad, and after I checked out Google Maps, I saw that it was possible to
get there. We ended up arranging the trip on the spur of the moment that day,
when we ran into each other at lunch, and we headed south at 2:45. It was
pretty fun. We talked about politics and stuff, which was interesting becasue
we’re both shades of anarchist. We also talked about plants and growing
stuff. James is fascinated with the idea of growing tropical plants at his home
in Buffalo; he’s already ordered some small banana trees. He says plants
always seem to grow really well under his care. We passed lots of rail
construction equipment, which was pretty cool, and we also saw a big corn
processing installation that looked like a bunch of tin cans of varying
hugeness and suspended from various heights by a bunch of pipes and stuff.
There was a loading dock for train cars, but the spur that led to it looked
pretty disused. Which is a shame. As we went further, vague industrial
buildings with giant, pointlessly manicured lawns gave way to distant motels on
the state highway leading to town, and then to farms. We crossed under the
interstate (a road crew had stashed some No Passing Zone signs underneath the
bridge), and then passed by some emptied cornfields to a gravel road. James
said this was the road he’d gone down to get to CERA a while ago on a
tour of some sort. So we walked down that road for a ways, but then came to a
point where we couldn’t see anything even vaguely CERA-like. To be
honest, I’d been expecting that since miles back, when we kept going
south at the rail intersection, instead of following the perpendicular track to
the west. I drew him a map showing where I thought we were, and where CERA was
(several miles away), and he conceded that maybe we weren’t there after
all. I would’ve spoken up earlier, but I wasn’t actually too
worried about the destination. It was just a fun walk. Later, when we looked up
a map, it turned out we wouldn’t have gotten there anyhow -- it was
at least half again as far as we’d gone, and we just barely got back in
time for dinner. Maybe we’ll try going to CERA some other day, but
probably not until the spring, because there won’t be much daylight soon,
and it’ll be cold too. James says he finds something to like in all the
seasons, except winter. It’s because he likes growing plants so much. He
says his dream locale would be somewhere subtropical (“Zone 10,” he
specified), where you can still tell what season it is, but the growing season
is year-round. All in all, it was a pretty fun trip.  

On Sunday morning, I went kayaking in the pool. Now, I don’t want to say
a lot, because I smell a jinx lingering somewhere, but I will say that it was
with a girl, and no one else showed up, so we two kayaked alone the whole time.
Anything more than that is going to have to get said later. I’ll just
leave you all with that.

Since I guess it’s as good a topic as any to close with, I fed Tenzing
today, and he’s getting nice and fat. While he was swallowing his mouse,
he looked awesome and you could maybe say savage; right after he got it all
down, he went right back to looking cute again. Especially when he yawned to
straighten his jaws back out. (Snakes do that.) He’s a pretty cool snake.
