My name is [withheld]. I live on Finney Trail. I visit Warder Park all the
time, and when I idly searched for references to it on the Internet, your plan
was the first thing I found.

First I looked at the maps on the front pages. I love maps. In fact, I plan to
someday get a detailed map of Finneytown, as soon as I can find one. After I
saw the maps I moved on to the next page. It horrified me.

You plan to completely raze Warder Park and rebuild it totally different. I
couldn’t believe it. Warder Park is untamed, and it takes all of its greatness
as a park from this wildness. Unlike, say, Winton Woods or Hummer Park, it
hasn’t been built over to accommodate everyone and his brother coming in. That
means that there are no docks on Burke’s Pond, there are no basketball courts
just off the main trail, and there is no amphitheatre in the middle of the
grounds. It’s one of the last places in Cincinnati that’s like this. While all
the other parks have been “fully modernized”, Warder stays mysterious and wild.

So I ask you: do we really need another tennis court, or another swimming pool?
Aren’t there enough already? What we need is a park that retains an air of the
unknown. I have no idea what’s in a lot of the entire park, and I can’t tell
you how much I enjoy the process of finding out new things. Just today I
bushwhacked back and found a brand new creek that I had never even suspected
existed. There are very few things that give me as much of a thrill as
discovering completely new places and seeing things I’ve never seen. 

But if the new plan you have here to change the face of Warder is instituted,
there will be nothing surprising. Everything will be mapped out in an exact
way, and every time you go in you’ll see the same exact trails, the same exact
skateboard ramp. Nothing will have changed. Nothing.

Do the taxpayers need to pay nine million dollars to have a park that maybe a
hundred people will know about, that will be interchangeable with the almost
adjacent Hummer Park, and that won’t be even a tenth of the size or excitement
of Winton Woods? What else could we be spending these nine million dollars on?
My school, Finneytown High, has recently had its budget slashed violently. All
of the Finneytown School District has, in fact. There are kids who could be
learning more, cops who could be patrolling more, roads that could be paved
better, and countless dozens of other things that are so much more important to
everyone than another new park. I don’t understand why we need to pave over a
sanctuary for everyone in the town, at a huge cost, to provide something we
already have. I say we nix the Warder Park plans and leave well enough alone.

Thanks for reading,
