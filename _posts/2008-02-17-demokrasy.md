I should stop spelling stuff wrong. Anyhow, here’s my latest project. I’ve
created a Student Initiative, which is where I come up with an issue and have
the students vote on it. To get it on the ballot, which is this coming 18th and
19th, I had to collect a hundred signatures first, so I did that yesterday and
Friday. I’m going to an open forum tonight to defend my position against
potential detractors. What’s my issue, then? I want to repeal the shoe
requirement in the dining hall. What else would it be? As I was collecting
signatures, I found that people had more hangups about this than I would have
expected. Mostly it’s just been “Wait, that’s unsanitary” (it’s not, at all) or
“There’s a law” (there definitely isn’t).


The weather is excellent here. Today we’ve got a big snowstorm moving through,
leaving us 5 to 7 inches of snow on top of the 6 or 8 we already had. At this
rate, I’ll have all sorts of snow for the giant snow sculpture I’m planning.
Last night I had to get out of the dorm room, so I went biking. This was at
about 0100, which coincidentally was when the campus pub, Lyle’s, closed after
its first night of business. And, coincidentally, there was a bit of rain
coming down and freezing onto the ground. So these little groups of drunk
people were floating around on ice-coated campus. It made them delightfully
unstable. I never saw anyone fall down, but many were evidently having trouble.
For my part, I was on a bike, and discovered the ice the hard way. I thought it
was slish, and took a sharp turn, and the bike bolted out from under me. I
didn’t get hurt, though. I just got informed. It was actually pretty amusing.
After that I just kind of biked around the town. I had planned on biking north
to the athletic fields, but the path leading to them hadn’t been shoveled at
all, so it was sleeping under five or six inches of snow. Not good for biking.
Instead, I just cruised around town. It was quiet -- go figure. I had to be
careful of the ice, but I managed not to fall over any more. I did get some
good fishtailing in.


I’ve been doing stuff with the newspaper here:

  lounge.](http://web.grinnell.edu/sandb/archives/volume_124/sandb_vol124_num16.pdf)
  (Page 10) (Also note list of Student Initiatives on page 3, if you’d like) 

Here are some pictures I’ve taken.
