I’m going to write about a bunch of stuff that I only half understand, or
actually probably quite a bit less. Cool? Alright, here goes.

Just in time to probably be unable to do anything about it, I’ve started
getting intensely interested in learning about nutrition and living healthily.
I’m not sure exactly why I’ve just gotten into it so hard, but I
think maybe it’s because of bread. I’ve been thinking a lot, on and
off, about bread lately.

If you’ve been reading this blog for a long, long time, you may remember
a time in my first year at college when I had just discovered something called
the paleo diet. The premise of the diet is that you should eat what humans
evolved to eat, and humans did all that evolving before the following things
existed, making them verboten: grains, processed vegetable oils, and refined
sugar. So I did a little one-week trial of the paleo diet where I hardly stuck
to it at all and didn’t notice anything change very noticeably in my
health, and then I guess I forgot about it. But over the last year or so
it’s been creeping back into the forefront of my consciousness, for two
reasons. One—Since I finally read _The Omnivore’s Dilemma_ and a few
other books about food, I haven’t been able to shake the notion that
I’m almost certainly not eating how I should be, and that I should figure
out the right way without too much delay. Two—It keeps popping up here and
there in things that I read. Since one of my big convictions is that our modern
civilization is deeply wrong in almost every direction, the stuff I read has a
certain tendency to mesh with that idea, and the way of eating that makes the
most sense from that viewpoint is basically paleo. So whenever food comes up,
which it does fairly often since it’s so important to the world and its
ecosystems, I’m likely to end up reading something about paleo (or one of
its close cousins). As a result, for a while I’ve been carrying around a
vague idea that paleo is the right way to eat, but I hadn’t actually gone
to the trouble of figuring out whether it was actually true, or what the
science is.

With that notion in tow, I started minimizing the bread I eat. Not based on any
careful reading of anything in particular, just out of a knowledge that grains
are somehow supposed to be bad, and industrially made bread is even worse
because of all the chemicals and processing involved, and anyhow I get a huge
scoop of rice at school lunches so it’s not like I need more carbs. But
having given it up, I noticed that I missed it. Those who’ve seen me eat
dinner at Grandma & Grandpa’s house will probably remember some of the
many occasions when I took home the loaf of poppy-seed-adorned bread that
Grandma & Grandpa got specifically for the meal, though you may not know that I
often finished the entire loaf during the car ride back home, sometimes
alongside a can of root beer. I really enjoy bread. So I thought it was high
time to figure out whether it was responsible for me to keep eating it.

You could pretty reasonably ask, Why? Clearly I’m the kind of person who
can eat pretty much anything, in tremendous amounts, and never gain a pound. So
why should I want to diet? Basically, because being overweight isn’t the
only way to be unhealthy from your diet. It’s just the most visible. In
fact, from what I’ve read, it’s pretty likely that _most_ of
the ways of being unhealthy that we see in civilization are results of eating
bad stuff. Things like: diabetes, heart disease, and most cancers; also things
like: acne, headaches, and feeling sleepy during the day. I generally feel
pretty healthy, but even that’s not a guarantee of anything because some
of these diseases of civilization just wait and build up without you noticing
until one day you go to the doctor and she tells you, “You have
diabetes.” Or later on in life, “With your arteries, you’re
set to have a heart attack within the year.” And I realized a few months
ago that my relationship with food here couldn’t possibly be healthy: the
lunch ladies noticed that I eat a lot, so they started giving me extra of
everything (including the rice I mentioned), and since I hate to let food go to
waste I ate it all every day, and since it’s what you do I came back home
each day and had a nice big dinner too, followed by snacks here and there until
bedtime. At restaurants I’ve gained a reputation as the garbage
disposal—I make sure none of the food gets thrown away, sometimes by asking for
a doggy bag but usually just by eating it all (and then realizing when I stand
up how bloated I am).

So I finally started reading about the paleo diet, and also some of its kin,
like the Weston A. Price Foundation’s diet and the (ambitiously named)
Perfect Health Diet and various little variations on the paleo diet created by
bloggers around the internet. I wasn’t disappointed; it basically all
makes sense, and all the forums about the diet (of which there are a lot, most
of them built around the idea of helping people learn more about why things
work the way they do and how to do the diet) are full of people talking about
how much better they feel when they eat paleo-style and how much weight
they’ve lost and kept off (or, if they started already thin, sometimes
about how much muscle they’ve put on). The caveat here is that I
haven’t really looked into the opposite viewpoint very carefully so far,
but that’s next on the list.

There are a whole lot of scientific explanations for different facets of the
diet. These are what seem to strike me as three of the most central parts.
First: carbs are kindling and fat is firewood. Most people constantly supply
their body’s fireplace with kindling, so it only burns that, and never
lights the bigger fire below. (Imperfect analogy alert: kindling that goes
unburnt becomes new firewood.) But a fire burns stronger and steadier on
firewood. Eating fat turns out to actually be a good thing, contrary to what
most people learn, because your body runs better on it.

Second: now that you’ll be eating more fat, it’s important to pay
attention to what kind of fat, and the healthy answer is, “Not vegetable
oils.” They’re modern Frankensteinish inventions of factory food
technology and science is continually finding new ways they’re bad for
you. Probably unexpectedly, and counterintuitively, what’s recommended
instead is animal fats, like the ones that are inherent in meat, as well as
butter, lard, and tallow. Other alright fats include the fat you get when you
eat avocados and nuts and such, and coconut oil (which gets heaps of praise),
and debatably olive oil.

And third: when grains grow on their plants, they don’t want to be eaten,
because they spread by wind, not by getting eaten and then pooped out. So they
make chemicals called lectins that give a stomachache to any animal that eats
them. Then we figured out that if you cook grains the lectins aren’t
powerful enough to bother you. But they’re still there, and they build up
and cause bad health along down the line.

There are other things that I haven’t mentioned too, like getting lots of
variety of fruits and vegetables because they’re good for you in a slew
of different ways including providing you with vitamins and other
micronutrients, and also trying to eat as fresh as possible so you know the
provenance of everything. One of these little other bits is intermittent
fasting, which is that thing I tried out the other day. I had actually been
thinking about fasting even before I started reading so much about paleo. A
blog post about fasting once a week got me thinking about it; the guy explained
it as having lots of different good effects, like getting him to be less
automatic in his behavior with food, and reminding him what the starved half of
the world’s people chronically feels like, and reducing his ecological
footprint. Then I found out that there’s a sizeable contingent of paleo
people, as well as other people, who fast once a week because it’s
supposed to do some good things for health, like slow down high-strung
metabolisms and also apparently even lengthen lifespan. Though I kind of just
went off half-cocked on the fasting thing, without a particularly clear idea of
what I was supposed to be accomplishing, besides maybe shrinking my enormous
appetite by a size or two. (In that I think I might’ve succeeded, at
least briefly.) Maybe I’ll try it again, or even regularly, but I’m
going to keep reading.

So I think I actually would like to try this out. But here’s the thing:
I’ll be able to control it as an experiment for maybe three weeks. Then I
have another week of school lunches, and then I’m off to a bunch of other
countries. These are all countries with incredibly diverse cuisines that I want
to try out. I’m not going to skip having pizza in Italy, or a baguette in
France, or a pretzel in Germany. (Though sausage and sauerkraut are highly
approved foods.) And perhaps more to the point, as a dumpster diver I
won’t have the opportunity to be too picky about what I eat. Some days
I’ll probably get lots of vegetables and maybe some freshly thrown-away
meat (which I’ll cook very well, don’t worry), but other days I
might find a bunch of bread or a bag full of donuts or something. So I guess
maybe I’ll have to wait a little while before figuring out this whole
health thing entirely. But I guess I’ll do what I can while I’m
traveling. Go fishing in Mongolia, look for uneaten sausages at Oktoberfest,
keep an eye out for fresh healthy stuff in dumpsters.

I’ll probably write a few more posts soon and probably none of them will
be about nutrition. It’s just I’ve been thinking about it a lot
lately.

Also, I mentioned a lot of stuff in this post and didn’t link to any of
it. So here’s a whole constellation of links to keep you busy if you feel
like reading some of the stuff that I’ve read.
