So I went to Barcelona, and stayed in an abandoned ice cream factory with a
variety of people who do such things as fly on the trapeze and put on
medieval shows for the community around. After only two days, though, I
started feeling the pressure to get moving to a different country. I
definitely gave Spain its fair allotment of the short time I have --
three whole weeks. That leaves me only two and a half weeks to share between
France *and* Italy! Preposterous.

I managed to hitch in an almost straight shot to Lagorce, France, which is
not the sort of place you’ll have ever heard of. It takes several turns
down successively smaller roads before you even find the name of this village
on  the local road signs. But I was on a mission, coming here.
There’s a website called HelpX, where people can put notices that say
something along the lines of: “Come help out on my
farm/hostel/house/whatever, and I’ll give you free room and board while
you work.” I found such a place there, but I couldn’t actually
contact the people running it, because I didn’t want to pay the 20
euros to become a member, and then use the site only once before leaving
Europe. So I decided to take a chance and just go to Lagorce and try to find
the couple running this place.

I feel like I’ve reached some sort of Zen level of traveling where
everything turns into serendipity. In hitching here, I got my first ride on a
motorcycle, as well as a ride with a guy who had just returned that morning
from a kitesurfing vacation in Brazil, and a family who went several miles
out of their way to get me to Lagorce. Their son asked me what the specialty
American food was, and when I got off, he gave me cookies and two lumps of
sugar -- this must be tantamount to the widow’s mites. That night
I discovered from posters around the town that the following day there would
be a festival all around the village. I also explored a little bit. What an
incredible place: all the houses are medieval stonework, all crowded
congenially onto a tall ridge overlooking fertile valleys.

Today I went to the festival, which was all about how to improve the world,
starting at the local level. Some people from a local organization that saves
heirloom seeds and donates them to Africa and the rest of the world knew the
couple I was looking for. For a while there was a question of whether I could
stay and volunteer -- not because I showed up unannounced, but because
they actually had two previously arranged volunteers showing up at 2:00
today. But they made a space for me, and now I’ll be here for about a
week. Which is I think the longest time I’ll have spent in a single
place since I started journeying.

Anyhow, what is this place? It’s a nascent “bed and diet”
-- differing from a bed and breakfast in that it’s going to cater
specifically to people who want to go on vacation and still follow the paleo
diet or one of the various diets like it. How perfect is that? The couple are
Martin and Nina, Danish and German respectively, and the other volunteers are
two Calgarians named Marian and Addy. We’ve already talked a lot about
the paleo diet and how much sense it makes and how many problems it can
solve. I plan to do some serious learning here. And of course, some work for
them. And some good eating as well. And it’ll be nice to not be
constantly in motion, too. Just having a home for a week in this tiny French
village. Here, imagine me heaving a deep, relaxed sigh. 


By the way! I’ll be here Thanksgiving Day, and I’ll have a stable
internet connection. I don’t know about a camera, but when I think of
an idea of what I can do, I’ll write something about it here.
