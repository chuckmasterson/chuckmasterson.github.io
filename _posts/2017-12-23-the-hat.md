Misty got this hat, from our friend Willow. And somehow, it was never the same twice. Not all of
Mistyâ€™s head gets cold at the same time, so they have to arrange it very particularly.

In all of these photos, Misty was not *trying* to make the hat look ridiculous. It just kind of
happened.

P.S. My phone camera has decided to add a tiny green rectangle to all my pictures. Time to find a better camera.
