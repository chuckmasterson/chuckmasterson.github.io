You may know that I occasionally draw weird comics in my journal. Well, while I
was on the road, on October 20th, I hit the tenth anniversary of writing
regularly in my journal, and I decided a comic would be a good way to
celebrate. Now I’ve finally gotten around to scanning it so everyone can see
it. A lot of you probably already have, but you probably haven’t seen the bonus
that I put after it. [Here they are!](/assets/lg/10th-anniv-comics.pdf)
