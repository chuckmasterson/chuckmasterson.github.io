I suppose I just decided to leave my ’blog alone. This upset a lot of people. I
needed a month’s vacation, I suppose. Well, now I’m back. I think I’ll keep
with it. Probably.

I’ve been to all sorts of places. Like, West Virginia, and West Fork Dam. The
thing is, if I tried to write down everything I’ve done since last time I
posted, I’d have at least five pages, and I don’t have the patience to write
all that down. So I think I’ll just talk about the trip to West Fork. In fact,
I’m going to copy it down straight out of my journal. Let me go get it.

That wasn’t my best writing ever, but it was okay, and you get the idea.

I’ll keep you posted.
