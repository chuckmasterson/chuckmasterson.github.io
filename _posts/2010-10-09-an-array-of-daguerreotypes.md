So, as promised in the last post (which was #2 of 3), here are the pictures.
The good ones.

This was a lookout in a giant lava flow. It was built out of rocks provided by
the volcano, and had directions to look for every mountain in visible range.
But we couldn’t see any of them, because it was foggy. Still: great lava flow.

Here are two pictures of our embarrassingly large house.

And here are a few pictures of the hike that Grandma and I took along the river
nearby.

the stream we’d followed split off from the big river." %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 030.jpg" caption="This was underneath a
natural rock overhang by the trail that had a hole in the ceiling." %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 033.jpg" %}

This is the Mount Bachelor parking lot, which is massive, but the mountain is
actually not Mount Bachelor but another mountain near it somewhere. I don’t
remember what its name is.

Obsidian Flow." %}

With Joe for scale, this is what the flow looks like…

and how positively enormous it is.

Here’s a diner that we stopped at in Mitchell, Oregon. Besides the traffic
cones, this thing has walked in straight out of the Old West.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 057.jpg" %}

Near the John Day Fossil Beds, the geology started getting interesting.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 058.jpg" %}

Here’s a little hike through an area of green clay near the Fossil Beds museum.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 061.jpg" %}

You can kind of make out the green color in this picture. Grandma was trying to
snap a picture of it the whole way down the trail, but never thought she got
the green really captured. Then she took off her sunglasses and decided maybe
she’d gotten it okay after all.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 066.jpg" %}

On the highway away from the Fossil Beds, for no discernible reason, is a tree
full of shoes. There’s no sign there explaining it, and no evident reason why
this tree should attract (or grow) shoes. When we saw it, there were some
people there, putting on another pair. We asked if they knew what this was all
about. No idea, they said.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 071.jpg" %}

I already posted some pictures of the Painted Hills, but I have some more you
should see. For example, this one where the moon posed on a point of rock.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 085.jpg" %}

And this one where Joe ate it.
{: .no-indent }

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 086.jpg" %}

And this one where he’s good at sports.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 088.jpg" %}

Or how about a plain and simple one?

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 091.jpg" %}

And here’s Crater Lake. What a lake.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 097.jpg" caption="Wizard Island." %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 099.jpg" caption="Diamond Peak?" %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 100.jpg" caption="Panorama" %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 101.jpg" caption="The Phantom Ship" %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 103.jpg" %}

Here is a sample of the mountains you can see from Garfield Peak on Crater
Lake. Like I said, you can see every mountain in the world from up here.

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 105.jpg" %}

This is the old-growth forest we walked through to find the waterfall. I don’t
think I’d ever been in an old-growth forest before. I certainly don’t intend
for this to be my last time.

Falls." %}

{% include fig.html src="Oregon Etc 114.jpg" caption="Grandpa, successful and proud." %}
