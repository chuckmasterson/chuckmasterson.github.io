When I was a kid my parents took my brother and me on a road trip to see the great American West.
I may have been twelve; I remember that when one of them bought me a cool cowboy hat and I found
a turkey feather to put in it, I thought I was the coolest kid around. We slept at drive-in
campgrounds and listened to classic country and we went to see oh so many views. They were the
grandest views in the country, some of the grandest in the world. We looked down from the heights of
Yosemite, watched Old Faithful erupt in Yellowstone, goggled at Meteor Crater, and peered down into
the incomprehensible vastness of the Grand Canyon. And as I followed the family from one view to the
next, I thought: What’s the fucking point?
{: .force-drop }

I didn’t think it in those words. (For one thing, I was a Good Kid, and kept myself to a strict rule
of not swearing.) In fact I never got particularly close to consciously forming a thought like that.
But I do remember that after seeing each sight, though I thought they were quite awesome and all, we all
seemed satisfied for the moment but anxious to get to the next one, and we moved on basically unmoved.
Nature was for us on this trip a trick elephant, and we watched her most spectacular stunts---come on,
blow that geyser!---because that was what Nature was good for. We knew because the conservation movement
had said so. It had put aside the National Parks because here were the finest views Nature had to offer,
the most pristine landscapes unsullied by the hand of Man, a showcase of that beautifully alien realm
where an anarchy of bears and wolves and trees and moss is still allowed to flourish. You could tell it
was special because there were signs along the trails warning you to keep off the pristineness. But
I couldn’t help but notice that I felt closer to nature on the squishy banks of tiny Burck’s Pond up the
street from my house, next to a deteriorating asphalt path for dog-walking neighbors. My brother and
I would come up at night, sneaking in through back yards, and catch bullfrogs with our bare hands,
grinning with that specially childlike exhilaration, then lob them back into the water.
And on that grubby shoreline, strewn with ruined old orange plastic fencing and occasional bits of old
paper, I felt as alive as I did overlooking the greatest views of the continent, if not more so. Well,
perhaps my nature appreciation faculties were deficient.

On Sundays, back at home, if my mom was persistent enough to drag me out of bed where I’d otherwise be
sleeping till noon, we went to church, and it was the same deal. Everyone in the congregation made quite
a show of very clearly Being Religious. You could tell from how many times they stood up and then sat
back down again, how serious their voices were when they recited the Apostles’ Creed, and how they used
words like *hallowed* and *kingdom* and *thine*. The songs were very pretty, but I spent most of my time
picking the little communion registration cards out of the holders on the backs of the pews and filling
them out with funny names and addresses. I remember the little picture of wine and grapes next to the
blanks on that card better than I remember a single word Pastor Curry said. It was okay, though; he was
doing all the religion up there at the pulpit, and all I had to do was follow along in the hymnal and
sing approximations of the right notes, and I’d be fine. Religion was a spectator activity, and what was
important was being there and expressing the appropriate marvelment. Once you did that you could go next
door to Wendy’s and get a Frosty.

I am led to believe that Christianity can be a force for great spiritual and emotional good in people’s
lives. Perhaps some people can even derive that benefit from a suburban church that’s hemmed in by
a huge parking lot and the intersection of two major arterial streets. But its emotional impact on me
mostly consisted of introducing me to new depths of emotions like impatience. And discomfort. And
I don’t think there’s a single word to describe the emotion of being at a church summer camp with an
Australian *Survivor* theme (I don’t remember if I was sorted into Bonzer or Fair Dinkum tribe) and
being expected to sing along to all the stupid songs and getting shepherded through a series of
demeaning and not-remotely-fun games with heavyhanded moral lessons by a group of vapidly smiling young
adults whose heads you suspect would sound like empty coconuts if they banged together, and fantasizing
about burning the whole accursed place down---*indignation* doesn’t quite say it somehow---but I learned
that emotion too from my childhood experiences with Christianity. What I never experienced, never even
suspected I could be brought to experience by religion, was awe, wonder, *encounter* with some entity
grander and more ancient and intelligent than I could hope to comprehend.

It wasn’t as though I had never felt that. In fact the pursuit of it was one of the main objects of my
summer, evening, and weekend free time all through my teen years. But I pursued it by creekwalking.
A creekwalk allowed me (and usually my little brother) to escape the rectilinear world. With the air of
smooth criminals, we would stroll down the street past the little boxes made of ticky-tacky until we
found that magic spot, the flaw in the weave---a gap between the bushes edging someone’s backyard,
usually---where we could slip into the wild fringe where no one goes and no one looks: the creek, and
the scrubby margin on either side of it, land topographically worthless to developers, and thus allowed
its freedom. We could walk up and down this squiggly, alterdimensional world for hours and hours and
never see another human. Evidence they’d been there, sure, like excavations and drainage structures and
little dams, but no presence of them except occasional moving cars or machinery far away up on the surface,
sighted in passing from odd low angles. Everything we found had an element of mystery to it, in that
world. It was uninterpreted. It had grown woolly and feral since its last human contact: old stone
bridges had collapsed, carefully bulldozed slopes had turned into tangly thickets of honeysuckle,
discarded chunks of metal had rusted into unrecognizable shapes, old bottles poked up out of the dirt
and seemed to have been lost from a Spanish galleon (even if on closer inspection they said <span
class="small-caps">7-up</span>). Up above in the world we’d stepped out of, every place was planned out
by some human mind to have one interpretation, more or less: House. Store. Gas station. But here, often
not fifty yards from that world, everything we looked at was an infinite matryoshka of interpretations,
bug on grass blade on dirt in forest, each with their universe of meanings, and the minds that devised
the signposted and house-numbered boxes up on the surface seemed impossibly small, because here was
a place with its own intelligence, one that genially declined to be subsumed by mine.

The trouble was, having had these encounters that were, I now believe, of fundamentally the same nature
as the experiences of a devout Christian in church, I had no idea they could be understood---might even
*best* be understood---in any way you could call religious. My father taught biology and chemistry for
eleven years. His father was a career high school science teacher. My mom’s father was a tenured
professor of general science for his whole career. Within my milieu it was conceded that religions
*exist*, and they probably (maybe) have some kind of validity to deal with some nebulously defined
sphere of human experience. But anything not clearly labeled *religion* was felt to be quite obviously
in science’s exclusive domain. I took a high school bio class and learned a few more things to
appreciate while on a creekwalk, but I never learned a thing about *why* I appreciated them or, worse
still, what that appreciation might *mean*.

I did catch occasional glimpses of another way of seeing things. I was an all-devouring reader and
somewhere found a copy of John (Fire) Lame Deer’s *Lame Deer, Seeker of Visions*. Lame Deer’s
description of a spirit quest made a strong enough impression on me that even though I haven’t
reread the book since I was probably eleven years old, I still remember his four hot days, with no food
in the dry red dirt, with the quality of a legend or a bedtime story. But like when I pushed through
a book on string theory as a teenager, I read Lame Deer’s book when I was too young to really
digest it. His story became just a story, something with a tenuous connection to “the real world”
perhaps, but certainly not to *my* real life. In my real life religion was what we did at church. And
since what I did at church was basically to wait for church to be over, the word *religion* came to have
no useful meaning at all for me.

Nonetheless, whatever it was, it seemed important to a lot of people, so I tried to come up with a
definition that felt right. While I didn’t have much luck with that, I did burn through a whole
stack of bad ones. First I redefined it during catechism class as a thing that stresses me out
because I have to make up some stuff about how Jesus makes me feel, even though I’ve never met the
guy, and then tell it to a hundred people and try to make everyone believe it, even myself. In high
school, as I learned about the world, I redefined it again, without being aware of it at the time,
as a bundle of just-so stories that had all been conclusively disproven, but that I still had to
tell people I believed in---in a metaphorical sense, whatever that might mean---or I would go to
hell one day. When I left home for college, it took very little time for me to come into contact
with atheists, enough of them (for the first time in my life) that I had to take them seriously, and
very quickly the fragile wall I’d built around that house-of-cards definition [came cascading down]({%
post_url 2007-12-29-i-broke-it %}) under the weight of clear rationality; I redefined *religion* again
as a mass delusion that people buy into because their parents told them to and they’re too afraid of
Hell to give the matter a second thought. And at that point I shed Christianity and just dropped the
matter entirely. Poor religion. It never stood a chance.

It certainly didn’t help that Christianity, as I learned it from every source I encountered, was all
about escape. Its overriding goal, the direction all its theology pointed, was to get you off this
vale of tears, this wretched space rock, and into heaven where you belonged. Sure there was a little
more to it, but that stuff was minor details; the important thing was the Earth is a shitty place
and you should be focusing on making sure you go to Heaven once you’re done here, instead of an even
shittier place. Now, I had no problem with going to Heaven, although it sounded a little quiet and I
might get tired of all the lyre music. But getting there wasn’t really a goal that motivated me. As
I understood it, all I had to do was say out loud that I believed in Jesus, and I was set, so it
really didn’t seem like that big a deal to focus on when there were plenty of interesting things
happening down on Earth. And all this trash-talking of the Earth really put me off. I happened to
really like the Earth. It was a great home, very comfortable. Summer evenings by a Canadian lake,
particularly, were about as good as anything I figured Heaven could provide, as were snow days when
instead of going to school I could walk through an ice-coated world to the Graeter’s up the street and
get an ice cream cone. Why was everyone in such a hurry to get to Heaven? It seemed frankly suicidal and
unhealthy to me. And anyhow I noticed that even the most faithful Christians I knew hadn’t carried out
the logic of their creed to its inevitable conclusion and jumped off a cliff. That was all the proof
I needed that people didn’t *really* believe that strongly in Heaven, or at least figured it probably
wasn’t *quite* all it was cracked up to be.

I’m no expert on Christian sects. I imagine there are some out there whose understanding of the
relation between Earthly life and the Hereafter is more coherent and healthy. But the Christianity that
was presented to me amounted to an offer of escape from the place I loved the most, and it was
singularly uninspiring to me. The process of casting it off was traumatic, but mostly because I had to
make sure I was *really* sure I didn’t believe Hell existed before I made a decision that would
otherwise get me sent there, and also because of all the other people who cared about me and still
thought there *was* a Hell and I was now headed there. But I cleared those hurdles, along an utterly
typical just-got-to-college trajectory, and when I found myself free of the constant cognitive
dissonance and fear of divine eternal retribution, I found also that I didn’t miss a single amen of it,
and I never looked back.
