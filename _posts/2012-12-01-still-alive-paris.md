I lied about that unlimited free internet at the Apple Store; it turns out they
kick you out after about half an hour of you using the demo computers and
clearly not planning to buy anything. But I can come back again and again for
more half-hours.

So, anyhow, here I am in Paris, and after seeing a few, I can say with a fair
degree of confidence that this must be the most beautiful city in the world. I
guess that’s why it’s so famous. I’ve serendipitously showed
up on the day before the first Sunday of the month, which is the day when all
of the following are free: the Louvre, the Musée d’Orsay, the Arc de
Triomphe, tours of Notre Dame, and a bunch of other things that I won’t
have time to see. And in the evening, I’m meeting Flavia, a Californian
girl I met in Rome and who studies in Salamanca and jets to a new European city
each weekend to try and see as many as she can before graduating. Don’t
get too many ideas, though; it’ll probably just be a
friends-for-the-weekend thing. After a day tomorrow of running around like a
cat in a hamster shop, I’ll have a couple more days to see other stuff
that I didn’t have time for already, like the catacombs and other cool
stuff.

That’s it for now, but like I said, be expecting more blogs once I get to
England. Oh, also: there have been calls for me to put up a Christmas list. I
don’t know what to do exactly now that there are kind of two separate
branches of my family without much communication and no one will know what the
others are getting… maybe I’ll leave it up to you to exchange email
addresses and tell each other? or maybe I’ll get used to the possibility
of getting two identical gifts? or if you ask me to, I can split up the list
into two parts, one per half of the family? Anyhow, here are my only material
desires I can think of: 


*   A camera that isn’t terrible (my current one is, owing largely to a chipped
    lens and a refusal to ever believe that it has sufficient battery… the kind
    you can charge at an outlet would be good, because I don’t like how I have
    to buy AA’s for this one)
*   Some kind of hat that could keep rain off my head, and maybe even keep my
    head warm: I don’t really know what kind of hat this would be, but one must
    exist
*   A sort of smallish satchel that I could carry around if I didn’t want to
    carry my whole backpack – something durable, and big enough for maybe a
    book or two and a bottle of water and/or a little food, but not much
    bigger, so if I needed to I could hold it in my hands and sprint flat-out.
    This would replace my strategy of carrying stuff around in my cargo
    pockets, which makes it hard to run or jog or even hustle, much less
    bustle.
*   Books that I would like… but I’m hesitant to name any because, actually, I
    plan to hit the library pretty hard while I’m in town, so that no one
    including me would need to buy books for me, and so I won’t be too weighed
    down by a collection of them. But one that I’m almost sure I’ll want to own
    is *Unlearn, Rewild*.

If I think of anything else, I’ll put it in a comment. I ought to be
around!
