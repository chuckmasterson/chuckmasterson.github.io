Let’s get up to speed on what’s been happening. I’ve been here now for what
I’ve just realized is something over three weeks. Besides staff training, I’ve
gone on two trips, both four-days. The first one was just awesome. The
counselor I went with was Walter, and over the course of the trip we discovered
that we had just about everything in common. Such as: Edward Gorey books,
Calvin and Hobbes, linguistics (he’s majoring in it; I’m concentrating in it),
XKCD, and an odd sense of humor. I also believe he’s one of the only people in
the world that I could have a “Revolution 9” sing-along with. We didn’t
remember all of it, but we did sing together: 

> Industrial output.   
> Financial imbalance.   
> The Watusi.   
> The Twist.   
> &nbsp;   
> El Dorado.

We had campers on that trip too, most of whom were pretty reasonable. They were
all fiends for fishing, it seemed. One of them really wanted to catch lots of
animals and then kill and eat them. Or just kill them. Another one was this
very short guy who said his r’s as w’s, but managed to carry out an
Italian-influenced accent from his Italian upbringing. The effect was that he
sounded like a tiny mob boss -- which is terribly stereotypical, but in the
movies that is what all the mob bosses sound like. Incidentally, a weird number
of the kids in Walter’s cabin (cabins have 10 kids, and half of them go on each
canoe trip) had odd names.  Names like Strange, Quaintance, Zak, and Wisdom. I
would give you the first names that connect with those, but that seems like a
bad thing to do on the internet.  

The second trip, a few days later, was miserable. The weather was the main
reason: it was overcast for six straight days here, starting the day before we
left, and keeping up for a day after we got back. Also it was unseasonably and
unreasonably cold all and every day and night. So the kids definitely had low
morale, and we were all wet and cold. Also, the counselor was Jason, who wasn’t
as interesting as Walter, and seemed not to care a huge amount about the kids
or trip. He cared some, but to some extent he seemed along for the ride. I was
glad to finish that trip.  

I haven’t had much time to myself until today. I had one day off, which I used
for reading and walking around. Today I had another day off, and it was one of
my favorite days in quite a while. First I read my journal for a while, but
then I got really hungry, so I went to town and looked for a restaurant. One
wasn’t open yet, one didn’t serve food (only coffee), and one had a 45-minute
wait for food bcause of the Independence Day crowd. Finally, I found a
restaurant that I’m really glad I ended up at. I had my first
[pasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty) (that’s “păsty”) ever, and it was
delicious. It reminded me that I want to learn to cook; I think I’ll look up a
recipe when I get home, and make some. Not only do I want to know how to cook
so I can make food on my own, but I also keep remembering when I went to
Aaron’s house (this is Cincinnati Aaron) a few days before I left for camp. His
dad was cooking, and he told me, “The reaction of a woman to a man who can cook
is just amazing.” He illustrated with a dialog:  

> [Guy voice.] "Do you want to have some dinner sometime?"
>
> [Excellent, sort of timid falsetto for the woman’s voice.] "Uh, sure… where
> do you want to go?"
>
> "Well, I thought I would cook."
>
> "Reeeally?" [His eyes light up.] "For meeeeee??"

I remember these things. Anyhow, after I had that pasty and a cinnamon twist
for dessert, I went up to see the parade. That was kinda fun. They had some
cool old cars, including one with a horn that went “AHWOOGA”, and some Santa
Clauses and a fireman on a unicycle. I also found a man selling fruits and
vegetables from his pickup truck, and had a dollar’s worth of the most
delicious strawberries I’ve ever had. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to go
back to store-bought.  

Then I drove back up to camp and got ready to go on a wog. That means a trip
where I jog sometimes and walk sometimes. I wanted to go find a geocache at
Nichols Lake, and then swim in said lake. So I did that, and what’s more, I did
it barefoot. It was nice to feel the ground under me for the first appreciable
time in weeks. The swimming was nice, and I tried to offset some of the
farmer’s tan that I’ve gotten recently. I don’t go barefoot in forests too
often, though, so on the return trip my feet were a bit tender, and I was happy
to get to camp and stop walking. I drove into town and got an Italian beef
sandwich at the Ice Shanty, which is one of those places with a walk-up counter
that you order from and then you eat outside. An Italian beef sandwich,
apprently, is just like the girl at the counter said: it’s like an Arby’s
sandwich, “only better.” It had some pepper and spices on it, and I got it with
jalapeños. I had dessert, and then came back to camp. Then I watched the
fireworks across the lake with a bunch of other people on the waterfront steps.
And finally, since it’s my day off and I hadn’t done it for a while, I came to
the computers and wrote a blog for you all. And now it’s over.
