I know, I haven't written a blog post in about two months. But I've actually,
secretly, been putting in more work on the blog than I ever have before. It's
just that it's all programming work. Because I've moved the blog off of Blogger.


Why? Well, I'll have a whole big post about that, but the short story is that
Blogger is just completely terrible. But I'm not going to go into that; in fact
I'm not going to go into much of anything at all right now, because it's a
preposterous hour of the night, and words cannot describe[^1] how ready I am to be
done with this project and make chuckmasterson.com a real thing. This is the
both the last post in Blogger and the first regular post on the new Chuck
Masterson's Actual Blog. (And really it's only on Blogger for the benefit of
anyone who might be subscribed to Blogger somehow or another, so you see that a
new post is here.)


I'm looking forward to writing a bunch of stuff, but it'll have to wait another
little while until I've had enough of a break from the blog; until then, have a
look around and enjoy. And let me know what you think.

[^1]: Well, actually, I think they could, but not words that I currently have the
    ability to assemble.
