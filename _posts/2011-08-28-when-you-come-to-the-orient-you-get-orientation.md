I played chess. I should explain. Victor, who I’ve mentioned before, has
four basic activities: work, sleep, eating, and chess. The last several weeks
that I was at home, he was living there, due to being homeless and unfortunate
in various ways. So he wanted to play chess with me all the time. And once I
had gotten packed up and was ready to go to Korea, there was nothing else for
me to do as I waited for the minutes to tick off but play chess. So
that’s what I did. I believe I won two of three, but I don’t
remember exactly. Then Dad woke up and in the psychosomatic chill that comes
before sunrise on even hot summer days, he drove me to the airport. We said
goodbye and then I walked into the mystery of my next year. 

First I had to pass through what may forever be the longest day of my life, at
37 hours. On the flight to Chicago, I heard a guy behind me talking to his
neighbor about Korea. “Are you going to Korea?” I said. He nodded.
“Teaching?” Nod. “Going with EPIK?” Nod. “See you
there.” But he was going to Gyeongbuk province, which, I later
discovered, has a different orientation, and I never saw him again.

Instead, when I landed in Chicago, I waited in the wrong place for a while,
then asked if I was in the right place, and a guy nearby asked me, when he
heard I was flying to Seoul, if I was going to EPIK. He was too, and to
Gangwon, in fact. We both found the right place together (it was a train ride
away in a completely different building), and joined what turned out to be an
EPIK party. All the non-Korean people who were waiting for the flight to Seoul
were EPIK teachers. I met, for instance, Matt, who has a handlebar mustache,
plays accordion, and was headed to Jeju Island. Altogether there were at least
thirty of us there. I sat in front of two, and they were bookending a Korean
girl who spoke pretty good English and gave us all sort of an idea of what we
were heading for. Unfortunately I couldn’t talk with them well, so I
mainly just slept the entire way.

Customs went by in about thirty seconds, and I got my stuff and headed to the
EPIK booth at the airport with all the other non-Koreans who’d just
stepped off the plane. We were all assigned a bus that was going to leave in
ten minutes, and then I realized I was supposed to find my recruiter, one of
the people who’d guided me through the whole application process. She had
been trying to find me, and she even had a card with my name printed on it. She
handed me an envelope and some home-baked ball-shaped walnut treats, which made
me soften a bit from how annoyed I’d been with the lack of communication
in the process. Then someone led me in a rush to the bus and I started
understanding the *bballi bballi* (hurry hurry!) culture of Seoul.

I sat with people from Canada and England and the USA, including Sean from
England, who would end up in the same village with me later. I hadn’t
realized how international a crew I’d be with. The bus driver took us
with pinpoint accuracy through traffic that never seemed a safe distance away
on either side, and we all got nametags and dinner. After dinner we all started
getting to know each other. I played a card game called baldrick with a South
African guy, an English guy, and the guy I met at the wrong desk in Chicago.
Pretty soon everyone collapsed from their long flights.

ight at the beginning of the next day we had a medical exam; a team of Koreans
quickly processed all 160-odd teachers, including blood tests and urine
samples. They realized what a wonderful welcome this was, and gave us some
snacks and drinks afterward. We had the rest of the day free to meet people and
make friends, so we all did.

The next three days went by in a stream of lectures on how to teach and evening
Korean lessons. Every day we got Korean food for lunch and dinner, and as I was
hoping, I really like it, most of the time. I still haven’t gotten past
the sound of the word “squid” and the sliminess of the animal, so I
don’t eat that, but maybe by the end of the year I’ll be eating it
every day. The kimchi there was terrific. In our free time we took walks around
Seoul, from which I’ll put up pictures sometime. One of the more
memorable things was a stone wall that used to surround old Seoul, and goes up
a hill that lets you see a good portion of the city from the top. I started
hanging out with two people, Alex and Cody, who both studied linguistics in
college. I didn’t know this about them until I’d been hanging
around with them for a while already. I think we came together through some
kind of linguists’ magnetism. We hung out a lot throughout the week, and
a few times I also hung out with Jo, although she turned out to be the
instantly popular type, putting her in sort of different circles from a schlub
like me. Mainly I just hung out with everyone I could, and had a great time.

On the fourth day we had a field trip to nearby Ganghwa Island. I didn’t
realize when I got on the bus that I was going to see North Korea that day, but
the first thing we went to see was the Peace Observatory, located at the
closest point on Ganghwa to North Korea, only 2.8 km from inhabited areas.
North Korea has set up a village there to look very healthy and thriving, and
you can use binoculars to look at people doing agricultural things and cranes
flying around without any regard for how this land might be somehow different
from the land across the strait. First there was a lecture (which I barely
understood any of) about the history of the Koreas, in a room with a view
across the border. Then we made asses of ourselves by taking mid-air jumping
pictures in front of the very sober monument to peace, looked around awhile,
and got bussed to a big restaurant for bibimbap.

After the rather good bibimbap—and the so-so dotorimuk (acorn jelly), which
didn’t taste like anything, and isn’t as good as what I’m
told you can get at other places—it was just a short walk down a street along a
rice paddy and we got to a hut where we would be trying out hwamunseok, the
traditional way to weave sedge mats. We all sat in a big room on benches with
iron spools hanging from boards in front of us. Then we learned how to be
proto–sweatshop workers. Each stalk of sedge took at least a couple minutes to
add to the mat, and we were only scheduled for about an hour. Given about a
year, we could have created something that you could actually have a seat on,
and cover your floor with. But with the time we had, we each managed to weave a
mat large enough to set a drink on—two if you’re careful. Based on
invisible criteria, the old ladies running the hwamunseok place declared
winners (all of them female as well), and we went on to our next tourist thing.

Things picked up a little, because we moved on to a dolmen, which is a giant
stone monument to the dead. There are thousands of these scattered across the
Korean peninsula, north and south, dating back to prehistory in many cases. We
had come to see an especially big one—maybe the biggest, but I don’t
remember. It was made of two flat stones tipped onto their thin sides and
buried in the earth, diagonal but parallel, with another flat stone on top,
large enough for several people to dance on and thick enough to shield you from
a sizeable bomb if you hid underneath. I think I remember hearing that it
weighed fifty tons. Can you think of any way for stone-age people to move that?
I guess maybe they buried the supporting stones, then had a huge crew of
strongmen with ropes drag it across level ground until they got it to the right
place, then uncovered the supporting stones. I’m suitably impressed with
whoever they were honoring.

Lastly we had a tour of the place where a palace used to be, back when the
capital had been moved to Ganghwa Island for a little while, a few hundred
years ago. The Koreans are serious about their ornate architecture. Every one
of the hundreds of roof beams was painted with an intricate design in red,
yellow, and blue, on bright green. The palace grounds were a very serene place.
I could imagine sitting down in any building there for several years of peace
and quiet to determine the nature of the universe. But I had a commitment to
teaching instead, so I went with everyone else back to the bus into Seoul, so I
could listen to the rest of the week of lectures.

I started getting a feel for Korean culture, too. It didn’t hurt that a
couple of our lecturers explained it to us so we wouldn’t have to figure
it all out for ourselves. The starting point for Korean culture is
Confucianism. Confucius, whose name is known all across even America, though
his words aren’t, had an idea for how society should be. There were wars
and strife going on all around him, and his idea was this: everyone has their
place, and let no one try to break out of it, and let the structure of society
be sacred. For a long time it was this way all acros Japan, China, and Korea,
but now Korea is the only country left that still has Confucianism at the
center of its culture. The effect for Koreans today, and for me, is that
there’s a hierarchy, and everyone has their place somewhere there. You
can move up the hierarchy as you get older, but don’t try to overturn it
with brash young ideas, or you’ll get nowhere but ostracized. Old people
are given everything here: special elevators to subway stops, seats everywhere.
When we were in a bus together once, Cody, who has studied Korean culture a lot
harder than I did, told me to get up from the seat I’d taken, and that I
should never sit down in an even moderately full bus ever, because I’m a
man and I’m under thirty. The principal of my school got to be principal
by sticking to schools for a long time, and now he has the privilege of a job
where, for much of the day, he can sit in a chair and read the newspaper.

As you can imagine, I chafe a bit with that, because if anyone’s a brash
young firebrand who wants to upset the political, cultural, and moral order,
it’s me. It might be a tough year for me, submerging my ego so as not to
be made miserable by those who have power over me and would feel wronged by my
even considering that I might be right and they wrong. I think I’m
starting to understand part of something else I heard about Korean society. One
of our lecturers told me that the typical idea in Western places about what
Korea must be like is: boring and stuffy. The Koreans, he told us, have a
response to this: Korea is actually “exciting hell”, while America
is “boring heaven”. Hell, I suppose, in that until you become a
geezer, you have to put your head down, work harder than any human should, and
go with the flow. Korean high school students, the youngest people who I
suppose are considered aware enough to take part fully in Confucian order, have
a saying that was explained to us: “Four, pass; five, fail.” At the
end of high school, Koreans take an enormous test that, basically, their entire
schooling career has been building up to. This test basically determines the
course of the rest of their lives. The saying, it turns out, is about hours of
sleep. Five hours is considered a reckless luxury. With this in mind, the high
suicide rate of Korean high-schoolers is fairly explicable.

But it’s an *exciting* hell, and I’ve picked up on that as well.
Over the course of my getting ready to go to Korea, there have been several
small towns that I thought I might end up in. For each one, I went to Wikipedia
to find out a little something about it. In America, this would be a most
unprofitable endeavor. The article for an American small town gives its
population, its demographics, and maybe the name of a park there. But in Korea,
every town has something like this, which I’m paraphrasing from the entry
for Hwacheon (population around 24,000): “The town is famous for its
annual ice fishing festival, which spans most of the month of January. Visitors
come from all over Korea to fish for *sancheoneo* (wild trout). The
festival’s organizers estimate that up to a million people visit the town
each year to take part.” Something interesting is never much more than
spitting distance away in Korea.

All of us at the orientation had known our provinces since before we landed,
and had been sorting ourselves into little groups based on those, but not until
the very last day did we actually find out what towns we would be going to.
Actually, I didn’t find out until I was on my way there. I was one of two
people given a confusing placement at the Hwacheon Office of Education. That
seemed to mean that I was going to be delegated to whatever school had need of
me. But then, on the day when we all said our goodbyes (Jo teared up, and
probably wasn’t the only one, even though we’d only known each
other a week), I got off the bus and into my co-teacher’s car in
Chuncheon (capital of Gangwon province), and she drove me to Hwacheon, but not
to stay. I was only meeting my predecessor, and after considerable confusion, I
found out that I would be staying not in Hwacheon but an hour or so away in a
little town called Sachangni.[^1]

First thing in, I got a tour of Sanae elementary school, where I’ll be
teaching. It has a dirt field out front, where a bunch of kids were playing a
pick-up soccer game. “Hello!!” they yelled out to me. “How
are you??” One ambitious little guy worked up the nerve to try something
more complicated—”I’m playing soccer!” I had been warned that
my heart would melt, but I was unprepared. They’re all so earnest, pure,
and rambunctious, or at least so they seem so far. I also got to see the inside
of the school, where you’re not allowed to wear shoes, and meet the
principal, who was in a chair reading the newspaper. The school is basically a
long hall with classrooms along it and a couple other buildings at one end.

One of the other buildings is the English classroom, or, as it’s styled
on the entrance, the Sanae English Experience Center. Here I saw how serious
the Korean government is about teaching kids English. The room has two TVs in
it with even bigger screens than Grandpa’s and Dad’s. One of these
is also a touchscreen, which allows one to use one’s hand as a cursor to
do stuff when the screen is displaying the screen of the computer next to it.
The other one, as far as I can tell, is never even used. There are English
teaching materials everywhere, with scarcely any place to put them all. All the
textbooks are the latest edition of 영어 (that’s *yeong-eo*, the Korean
word for “English”, and even though I know how to sound it out, it
still looks more like modern art than language to me). Two laptops are present,
both connected to a program that allows the teachers to send messages and files
to each other within a little school intranet. It’s pretty impressive.

And yet, besides “Hello”, “How are you?”, and the
occasional “I’m playing soccer”, the only thing that comes
out of the kids’ mouths without steady coaching and a clearly visible
written example is Korean. It leads me to believe that, becoming suddenly
profitable, the Korean government ended up being profligate and buying all
sorts of stuff for the schools, on the theory that it must be some good, and
it’s the right thing to do. This fits in with my view of Korean society.
I don’t know if this has anything to do with Confucius, but it’s a
very materialistic place. All through the orientation, the organizers were
giving us more gifts than we could handle. That’s the polite thing to do,
and they felt, I’m sure, that it was expected of them, even though by the
end I heard at least one person say quietly at an assembly, “Oh please
don’t give us anything else.” Your decency is measured by your
generosity. Also by your sense of style. I don’t know if I’ll be
able to work my way down, fashion-wise, to anything less ostentatious than a
button-down shirt and pressed pants this entire year, at least at work. (And so
it will be a big relief for me when I become a hobo and get to wear the most
casual uniform of any job outside of the Naked News people.) The government
spends a lot of money helping teach kids English with the latest technology,
which I suppose makes them a good government in the eyes of the South Koreans
(or at least so they hope). But it disregards the fact that snazzy technology
isn’t what makes kids learn a language. What does? I’m not sure
yet, and I can hardly claim to be an expert at this point (tomorrow is my third
day on the job), but I know that having a five-foot touchscreen to do a
fill-in-the-blanks activity on CD isn’t the best allocation of money.

After my tour of the school, I moved in to my apartment. It’s right next
to the school, giving me a walking commute of about two minutes, and kids
don’t really hang around after school, so I don’t have to worry
about having constant playground chatter slowly drive me mad. The school and
the apartment, while by no means at the top of the town, are at the top of a
steep rise above the main bulk of the town, so I can see almost all of
Sachangni from the roof (there’s a door on the third floor that leads to
a roof-level porch with an overlook and a clothesline). Surrounding the town
are mountains, mountains everywhere, the highest ones a little under four
thousand feet. Pervading the town are Korean military men, seen all the time
walking around in their camo, talking in groups or having pizza alone. Because
oh yes, did I mention? Sachangni is about twelve miles from the DMZ. When
people at home told me, “Don’t walk too far north,” I
chuckled and said something like, “I don’t think I could possibly
do that without realizing it,” but this means that, conceivably, if I
were an utter idiot and planned extremely poorly, I might just be able to walk,
not all the way into the DMZ, but probably into a line of angry and puzzled
South Korean soldiers trained to use big guns.

The best part of this apartment building isn’t the great view or the
underfloor heating or the nice balcony in my room. It’s the fact that
five other English teachers live here, all the ones in the town. This includes
Sean, the guy from England who I met on the bus away from Incheon Airport.
Turns out he came here because he loves to climb mountains and be in the
outdoors. We get along great. There are also Russell, a Scottish guy
who’s a little bit quiet, but still game for mountain climbing; Amanda,
an English girl who taught in Busan a couple years before and then went insane
in Bali for a little while; Ben, a veteran teacher on his third year
who’s now working at the Hwacheon Office of Education, and goes to
Chuncheon a few times a week, which will be handy; and Deanna, who I’ve
barely met yet, so the only thing I know about her is that she wants to climb
stuff and she plays Mortal Kombat with Ben. We’re going to have some
great times together.

Which is nice, because if these first two days at work have set the tone for
the year, it could be a long one. The teaching is going fine, although
I’m off to a bit of a rough start due to having never taught before.
I’m getting along just fine. The trouble is the office politics. On my
first day, my co-teacher sent me and Amanda a message asking if, as a favor, we
could come in half an hour early to school every day to open the windows and
prepare lessons. I was ready to accept this as a cruel twist of fate, but
Amanda thought differently, because she’s been here for a month, and
asked if we could leave at 4:30 instead of 5:00 if we came in early. This is
when difficulties arose. My co-teacher said we certainly couldn’t do
that, because all teachers come in half an hour early without pay, and
that’s just the done thing. But we pointed out that our contract says we
only have to work eight hours, and more can be required, but we have to be paid
overtime. My co-teacher took this as a total refusal of her polite request for
a “favor”—Amanda and I later agreed that a favor can be refused
with no consequences, and this was definitely an *obligation *instead—and so
she has begun to see us as mannerless jerks, apparently. We questioned the
hierarchy. I wouldn’t have done that, but Amanda was very confident in
her ability to appeal this, and also angry, because last Friday, she asked—as a
*real* favor—if she could leave half an hour early to catch the 4:40 bus, since
she wasn’t doing anything in the last half-hour anyhow, and they refused
her. And I went along with Amanda, swept up in her confidence. It’s
gotten escalated, first to the vice-principal, then to the Office of Education,
then to the EPIK supervisor. And now, apparently, a decent chunk of the school
hates both of us. Or maybe just my co-teacher does. We don’t know where
this will head next, but hopefully it only gets better.

Anyhow, at least the teaching isn’t too bad. At first I envisioned Korean
students as orderly, military-precise ranks of nearly identical black-haired
heads all sitting attentively and ready to learn. But really, kids are the same
everywhere, and trying to make military ranks out of them will fail in any
country. These kids are rowdy, they hit each other, and they have
personalities. They’re adorable. Now all I have to do is figure out if I
can teach them some real English.

By now this probably ranks among my longest entries here, but that’s
about all I have for you, so you’re free to go take a bike ride or
something. I hope everything’s going well over there. Keep me posted.

[^1]: In Korean it’s spelled 사창리, which works out phonetically to
    “Sachang-ri” (with *-ri* being, I think, a suffix that means more
    or less “ville”). But in Korean, if you have an ㅇ (ng) followed by
    a ㄹ (r/l), the ㄹ becomes an *n* sound instead. There are loads of little
    rules like that. Fun, huh?
