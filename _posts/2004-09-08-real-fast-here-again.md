I’m in homeroom again, checkin’ up on my ’blog. I’m mainly here to post the answers to that puzzle I posited to you all last week or whenever. Here are the answers I have:

- CH: Archaic, monarch, chemistry… there are many many of them.

- PH: Shepherd.

- SH: Dishonor. I knew another but I’ve forgotten it for the moment.

- TH: Thyme. No proper nouns, so I can’t accept “Thomas”.

Okay, there you have them. Bye now.
