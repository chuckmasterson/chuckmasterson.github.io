Hi everyone!

Most people who are likely to be reading this already know this bit of news, although I think there
may be one or two of you out there that this will be a surprise to: I’ve got a baby now.
<!--sep-->

This is the first post here in over a year, so there’s a lot of cool stuff that’s happened in my
life that I haven’t written about. For now, we’re going to ignore all that stuff. I hope to be able
to put together at least a brief summary of it sometime soon, in the style of the old-fashioned
Christmas letter perhaps. Trust me, it’s been a heck of a year and there are some exciting stories
to tell.

But for now, I’m just reawakening this old blog as a place to put baby pictures. That way I don’t
have to keep filling up everyone’s inboxes with copies of all the pictures I have, and I can put
them up in higher resolution, too. Yes, I realize this sort of thing is exactly why Facebook was
invented, but I hope at this point we can all agree that Facebook turned out to be a bad idea and
it’s about time we scrapped it.

This post doesn’t include pictures all the way from the very start of Ivor’s life back on December
26, because I’ve already emailed those pictures to most people who’d be interested---soon I want to
put pictures here that go back to his birth, so this blog can be a more complete record, but for now
I’m just going to catch up on the month or so since my last proper email.

So without further ado, then, here are pictures!

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-807.jpg" caption="Misty hung up a string of bells that we had hanging on
  the wall. It turns out that Ivor loves tugging on them, listening to their soft jingle, and watching
    them wave around above him." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-812.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-818.jpg" caption="Side-by-side with a picture from Misty's old
  scrapbook. He was almost 3 months old---we’ll get another side-by-side when he reaches the 5
    months Misty was in the picture." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-828.jpg" caption="With our neighbor Link (age 2). When asked if he
  wants to hold Ivor, Link gets the biggest eyes and yells out the hammiest, “YEAaah!”" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-830.jpg" caption="Oh hi" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-837.jpg" caption="Drunk on milk and totally passed out" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-844.jpg" caption="Wouldn’t it be nice to enjoy lunch this much?" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-856.jpg" caption="Practicing pushing himself up on his arms." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ivor-877.jpg" caption="Our racooon child dozing off." %}
