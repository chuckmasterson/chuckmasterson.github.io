For the first time in weeks, I’ve gone a day without making any serious
effort to do anything academic. Not coincidentally, I’m feeling pretty
content right now. 

Not that I’m going to be able to lounge like this all through spring
break. Mainly I’m going to be catching up to deal with how behind I am
with my MAP. Taking a MAP and a seminar at the same time, I knew I was going to
end up being behind about halfway through the semester, so I had planned from
the beginning on staying at college for break to have a nice, relaxing time
spent catching up and probably drinking a lot of tea and going outside.
Tomorrow I’ll start doing such things as work, but today has been my day
for not doing much of anything. For example, the remaining dwellers of EcoHouse
had a cuddle session where we put two couches together and lay there relaxing
and talking and eating pancakes with powdered sugar on them. This is something
that doesn’t really happen when classes are in session. Everyone has to
go to the library or something.

Besides work, there are other things I’ll be doing in the coming couple
of weeks. Finding a school in Korea to apply to, for instance. This is the way
the Korea system works: Schools that need English teachers post a job posting
somewhere or other. Recruiters—who are based in Korea and staffed by either
former teachers or Koreans who maybe know something about the process, or maybe
not—collect these job postings from wherever they are, and wait for
English-speaking college students to write to them. Then they work with the
college student to find the school he/she wants to apply to. At least,
that’s how it’s supposed to work. I’ve only written to one
recruiter so far (I’ll explain in a moment why this isn’t cause for
alarm), one whose name I got from the guy I mentioned in the last post, B. I
wrote to them because if I get a job through them, B. gets $100. But they seem
pretty lackluster, in most respects. They sent me a list of about a hundred job
postings, obviously not filtered in any way or annotated as to which ones I
might like more, and they didn’t respond to any of the questions I asked
in my email. So I’m thinking I’ll go with another recruiter. Sorry,
B.

Another thing I’ll be applying for is a camp that Willie told me about,
called Flying Cloud. He went there when he was a kid, and still raves about the
place today. It’s apparently the awesomest camp in the country, or at
least that’s what I gather from everything I’ve read and been told
about it. They teach kids primitive living and wilderness skills, mainly.
There’s no closed-toed-shoe rule, nor really any rule about most
clothing. At the end of camp, the kids all get new names, but they’re not
allowed to say those names themselves, because they’re descriptions of
the kids’ most awesome characteristics. Willie, and also another person
who knows FC, Julia, tell me that I’m exactly the kind of person who
should work there and that it’s definitely what I should do this summer.

Originally I was planning to be in Korea in the summer, so I could come back
after one year and it would be summer when I got back, and I’d be able to
start my Year of Adventure on the high note of the Rainbow Gathering and stuff.
But I had also been told that most programs start in August, so I figured I
might have to adapt the plan. Now I know that there are openings popping up all
the time, but FC sounds great enough that I should do that. Also, there’s
a chance that I wouldn’t be able to start in Korea in the beginning of
June anyhow, because of the FBI background check.

This thing is a problem. Not in the sense that it’s hampering me, but in
the sense that it just shouldn’t be a thing that needs to happen. I
finally applied for it a couple weeks ago, on a Friday. The first step is to
get fingerprinted. So, go to a police department, any one will do, you’d
think. But the one in town was charging $20 for a fingerprinting. They
recommended I go to the next town over, where they were charging just $5. I
jumped at that, and drove to the Jasper County Jail. It’s several miles
south of the town, and recently built, so that on Google Maps it still shows as
a cornfield among many other cornfields. They’ve got it set up so that
you don’t see any inmates unless you’re visiting them, so all I saw
was the dead, clean geometry of the inside of the attendants’ office. One
of the attendants—both were women who seemed jovial but probably a little
haunted underneath—told me that I needed an ORI number. They had no way for me
to look it up online, so I had to drive to the library in town. There was
nothing about an ORI number for the FBI, no matter where I looked, so I told
the attendant this. She called the FBI and they told her they don’t need
an ORI number. Thanks for wasting my time. They fingerprinted me with a very
expensive-looking machine the size of a podium. The prints they took
didn’t look so hot, which left me a little concerned, because I’ve
heard the FBI rejects unclear prints sometimes. I don’t know yet if they
were good enough.

So once I got my fingerprint cards, I sent them with $18 and a form to the
FBI’s fingerprinting place. It’s in Clarksburg, WV: go figure. Now
I wait for about a month. Once I get it back, I have to get it apostilled,
which is a fancier, more hot-shot version of notarized. It can only be done at
a few places in the country, and they take a long time to turn the forms around
too, apparently. Once it’s apostilled, I send it to the South Korean
government and they give me a visa, assuming they’re okay with my
criminal record, and they don’t think my passport photo is too yellow.
I’ve put the Post Office behind me in life, and once I put the process of
applying for this visa behind me too, I hope I won’t have to deal with
the federal government’s bureaucracy anymore. Although there’s the
chance that I’ll work as a park ranger in a National Forest at some
point, so I may be disappointed. Things like these—another is the BMV—are parts
of a highly stratified, mechanized, blocken[^1], industrialized society that
frustrate everyone. They frustrate me perhaps even more. I wish people would
get irritated by the more important frustrations, like the way you can’t
get through even the most important environmental legislation because of all
the businesses that don’t like them. But I digress.

That application is one thing I did last month. I guess there were some other
things. Mostly they were academics. This semester has been busier for me than I
ever realized a semester could be. I’m having fun, but I’m also
doing an awful lot of studying and not very much other interesting stuff. I
went to an a cappella group’s concert the other day, and all I could
think was, “I wish I were in an a cappella group. I could have so much
fun at this. And I’m way better than that guy who has the solo in
‘Never There’.” I’m going to FTP (Free The Planet), the
campus environmental group, but I’m not contributing much because I
don’t have much time to give and I also don’t feel invested because
I won’t be here to see the effects of most things. It’s a shame.
But I’m doing interesting things where I can.

For example, yesterday I went foraging for wild edibles with my friend Jordan,
who graduated last year but decided to live in town for a few years. He’s
writing a guide about wild edibles in this area, and he borrowed my Samuel
Thayer books and said they were even better than the guy he thought was the
real top of the line, Steve Brill. We went to a restored prairie south of town
and walked through it to see what was sprouting. It’s still pretty early
in the season, though, so there was precious little green, mostly the brown of
the dead grass. Jordan spotted some tiny sprouts in a bare area under a bush,
though. We bent down. They looked like parsnip sprouts, which we’d been
expecting to find. We pulled out the guide books. Then they didn’t look
so much like parsnip sprouts. They looked a lot more like poison hemlock
sprouts. So that was disappointing. But now we know that poison hemlock is the
earliest sprouter here, and that we have to wait a little longer for cool
things like parsnips and wild carrot to show themselves. We also phound some
pheasant pheathers and some old corn that I might try to make hominy with. It
was a nice way to get rid of a little stress at the beginning of a break.

Another thing I did was Imaginary Week in my journal. It was a much more
complicated story than I’ve ever really done before. It started out with
protests in DC that happened as a me-too reaction to the Mideast unrest. Then
some agents protecting the White House made the mistake of shooting someone who
was going to throw rocks at it. That made the protests really take on a new
vigor, and she was an environmentalist, so it took on an environmental tone.
Meanwhile I had been kicked out of the college because I didn’t make a
payment and didn’t get their warnings because of my spam filter, so I
decided I’d hitchhike to DC and join in the protest. A guy who gave me a
ride told me his daughter had some friends who were really into the protest, so
I met them, and we hung a banner from a government building. But then the last
guy coming down from the building got arrested, and the banner got taken down,
so we decided to get the crowd that was protesting at the White House to go
somewhere where their energy could be more effective. This was the headquarters
of what we saw as the do-nothing EPA, although if I were to write it again
I’d probably go with the Chamber of Commerce or something. We ended up
storming a press conference and telling the camera what was going to happen now
that we were really speaking for the people. It was kind of an unrealistic
plot, and my choice of venue was a little inexplicable, but it was fun to
write.

And for my MAP, I got people to respond to my test-survey thing. I had kind of
a small turnout, but decent, except that it was mostly college students.
Hopefully I can get a few more responses from non-students. It’s
difficult to convince people to take the survey if they’re not the type
of people who are interested in language and words, which is a type of people
that tends to be a lot more prevalent on the college campus. I need data. I
guess I can make do with what I’ve got, but I’m going to be on the
lookout for more people who’ll do my study. …Anyone you know?
I’m looking mostly for adults who haven’t gone to college. I
figured out a way for people to do it on their own time.

That’s about all in the way of interesting things, and I probably had to
stretch the definition of “interesting” even for that. Hopefully
the next time I write it won’t have been a whole month. I’ll
probably be 22, though. I know I’m not allowed to feel old among a
readership that’s probably made of only people older than me, but I still
do, a little. Anyhow, this fogey will write more another time.
