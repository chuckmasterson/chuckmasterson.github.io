I’m in accounting class right now, but even when I don’t pay attention, I
normally get great grades anyhow.

The big story so far today (it’s only 0842) is that it was perhaps three
degrees outside today, and I, as I do, insisted on biking to school. I’d lost
my gloves recently, but luckily my dad had some soon after I lost them. If I
hadn’t worn gloves, I would not have hands with which to type this. Even
through the gloves, it seemed like someone was spraying a steady stream of
liquid nitrogen at me. I noticed a prnguin on the sidewalk across the street.
And he looked cold, too.

That’s why this may have been the first time ever I was glad to be in band.

I had a heck of a creekwalk last Saturday. Here’s how it went:

Micah and I and (cringe) his friend Brian walked off down our street at about
1330\. We were wearing backpacks and thick coats and we were in the spirit for
adventure. At the end of North Hill Lane, we strode off a large hill into
Congress Run, which was only the conduit to what we were going to do today.
Slogging through plenty wet mud, we came to a pipe out of which the creek flows
and climbed up a pile of rocks and stuff nearby. We came out behind a roofing
company. Then we crossed over North Bend Road and found the beginning of our
second creek. It was about eight inches wide. That would change.

After a dog briefly chased Micah, we were on our way. The creek ran
unassumingly to the right of Stephanie Hummer Memorial Park, which we could see
vaguely through some trees. Then we were plunged into a huge forest, fairly
abruptly. The creek ran a little faster, and Brian noticed a deer on the other
side of it. I took ap icture. THis was the best creekwalk I’d been on so far.
It was so peaceful and it was so awesome. The forest was one of the better ones
I’ve been in. But the going wasn’t simple.

Creekwalking isn’t a sport for the meek. It involves climbing over logs,
scrambling up steep inclines, and not losing your footing in thick mud. We had
plenty of thick mud, because of the recent rains. We trudged through it to all
kinds of places we hadn’t seen yet. There was a dam. There was also a big
ruined bridge. And finally, after such a long trek, we came to Waterfall
Canyon: a huge gorge that rises about thirty feet above your head and has rapid
waterfalls running all through it. After a minute we realized we wouldn’t be
able to walk inside the canyon and we had to climb up its walls to walk on the
bank. I had to do something like in one of those cheesy movie scenes and tell
Micah and Brian, “Take my hand!” to pull them up.

We walked along the top of Waterfall Canyon a little ways and came to where the
creek triples: The Confluence. Here our creek and two other creeks join up down
a steep hill coated with two feet of mud and form an enormous swell that’s
probably twenty feet deep. It looked like something at the bottom of Niagara
Falls, but without the falls. I would not want to fall in there. With some
difficulty, we crossed all three smaller creeks (to avoid having to cross the
big one) and climbed up the steep hill (it was two steps forward, one step back
in that mud, let me tell you). We found ourselves across a fence from a horse
stable. Wll, we came out the stabulary’s driveway and were near an auto parts
store of some sort, and also a place called “Seymour Preserve (Cincinnati Park
Board)”. The dominating feature of this preserve was a towering power pylon,
shooting several hundred feet above us. I discovered then that the path marked
on my map that I couldn’t figure out what it was, was a power line. But Micah
and brian wanted to go home, so we did.

By now, the bell has rung out and I’ve gone home once and it’s the next day--I
did this in two days. I think this is plenty of update for this week.
