Not sure when exactly I’ll have a big block of time for writing all about
Oktoberfest, and at any rate I’m not finished here. But I thought I
should let you know I’m still kicking, despite the universe’s best
attempts to subtly eradicate me last night when I couldn’t find my
backpack in its secret hiding place in the dark, and ended up having to shiver
underneath a bridge with just my sweater and raincoat. Don’t worry,
I’m pretty sure I’m sleeping indoors tonight. I’ve drunk lots
of beer and discovered that it’s quite easy to get beer free here;
I’ve also given up paying for food because of the Viktualienmarkt. This
is a place near the center of town (the Marienplatz) that’s described in
guidebooks as things like a “foodie’s heaven”. At first I was
sad that it all cost money, but then I discovered the open-air restaurant, and
started honing my skills at “tabling”. This is a form of freeganism
where you go where there are a lot of people eating, and wait until someone
gets up and leaves behind food that you want. Then you just sit down there like
it’s your food, and eat it. That simple. But it allowed me, yesterday, to
not just eat but overeat.  I had both a lobster lunch and a whole wurst, and
some obazda. Today I had another sausage, and a pretzel, and some salad, and
some other stuff. The Viktualienmarkt is actually not very near Oktoberfest,
but at the festival grounds you’d better believe there’s plenty of
free food (and beer) to be found, even if a lot of it is pretty junky. Anyhow,
next time I’ll endeavor to write about something besides just eating. For
now, things are pretty good. Gonna meet some friends later and hang out and
maybe even take a shower. Pretty soon I’ll get out of München, and when
that happens I’ll try to let you know.
