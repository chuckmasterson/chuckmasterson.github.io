Moving out to the country. It’s a
very simple concept—what I mean to say is, there’s really nothing implied in it
besides the bare fact of leaving the city and living where there aren’t so many
buildings. But, if you mention “moving out to the country” to every person you
meet, each person will translate that one simple idea into a complicated vision
that’s fleshed out into a degree of detail that was never implied at all by the
original idea. And the strange thing is, it seems like almost everyone slips
automatically into imagining that their own very specific vision is, more or
less, the one and only way of moving back to the land.

I’ve noticed a lot of these visions over the last year or so as I’ve been
talking more and more about moving out to the country, and it seems to me that
you could sort most people’s visions into a few broad archetypes—each one based
on how that person thinks *they* would live in the country. Which one are you?

#### The vacationer 

If you’re the vacationer you’re really, at heart, a city person, or at least a
suburb person. You can easily picture going out to the country for a week,
maybe two weeks at a stretch. In fact, you might treasure that—it’s an amazing
annual way to unwind and wash off some of the stress of the daily grind. You
can go out and spend a while fishing or canoeing in lake country, or hike in
the mountains, or take an annual trip out to the forest and hunt some deer. But
to spend any stretch of time longer than a couple weeks is almost
inconceivable. You’re aware that some people actually do live out in the
country their entire lives, but you feel somehow that those people must be
missing something fundamental in life that you get from living in the city,
where the people are. Your version of “moving out to the country”, if you had
unlimited money, would be to buy forty acres out on the lakeshore or in the
woods or the foothills, where you could have a cabin built. Then you could take
off to it whenever you want. And since that doesn’t really constitute moving,
you’d also buy a house in an outer-ring suburb or a nice medium-sized town,
where it’d be at least a little peaceful, and maybe deer would visit your yard,
but there’d still be a grocery store and some good restaurants.

#### The hobby farmer 

You may have grown up on a farm, or maybe you just always thought it
seemed like a nice way to live. In any case, you’ve spent enough time in the
city and if you had the chance and the disposable income, you’d be done with
it and just move out to start a little farm in the country. You’d grow some
of your own vegetables, have a chicken coop—maybe even a little flock of
goats. You have no interest in selling at a farmers’ market, because you’re
just in this for the lifestyle, not to start a business. You might have an
abstract ideal of growing *most* or *all* of your own
food, but you’re not really planning on that too much: there’s a sweet spot
between hard work and relaxation. You’ll send canned vegetables to your
family out of town and trade some with your neighbors, but you’ll never sell
or turn a profit, and you’ll always depend on the grocery store, whether it’s
only your fallback option for the cold season, or whether it’s where you get
your “real” food, the staples and the day-to-day meat.

#### The doomsteader 

You’ve seen the handwriting on the wall. The system we all live in is dying,
and it won’t be long at all before it falls apart in a very big way.  When that
happens, the city will be a great place to get killed quick: as soon as the
grocery store shelves start getting bare and the fuel pumps are all empty, the
city will turn into one big, seething riot. You could buy a lot of guns and
take your chances, but your odds with those guns are a lot better in the
country. If you had unlimited money, you’d buy land somewhere far away from
everyone, lots of it, and you’d build a bunker underground stocked with ten
years’ worth of canned meat, vegetables, sacks of flour, sacks of beans, gas
masks, guns, and ammo. You’d make sure there was enough room for your family
and maybe a carefully chosen cadre of friends, but you’re suspicious of letting
too many people know your plans, because if your location is known when the
SHTF,[^1] that’s the first
place all the roving hordes of cannibals will go. When you mention roving
hordes of cannibals, you’re sort of joking, but only halfway.

#### The organic farmer

You’ve read every book Michael Pollan has written, and you know that America
desperately needs a generation of new farmers—and they need to be ones who will
respect the land itself, who won’t degrade it the way fifty years of
industrialized agribusiness has, washing away an inch of topsoil every year,
dousing the entire country with billions of pounds of poison, creating a dead
zone in the Gulf of Mexico that keeps getting bigger each season. You’re
probably young, and probably college-educated, but when everyone tried to tell
you to get a career in industry, you knew that wasn’t your real calling, so
you’re walking the talk by joining the movement of young people going out to
farm.

You have a few acres of vegetables and you work incessantly, from
dawn to dusk at the very least, through the whole warm season: tilling,
planting, weeding, continuing to weed, weeding again, weeding some more,
harvesting, selling to affluent people at the farmers’ market for meager
profits. You curse Monsanto and Archer Daniel Midland and all the other
agribusiness multinationals that use their billions in profit to keep small
organic farms from becoming anything but a small niche market.  But you hold
out hope, deep inside, that Americans will slowly realize that they need to eat
real food, and that something bad will happen the megacorporations, or the
government will force them to stop.  

#### The dropout 

Fuck the system! You’ve lived your entire life doing what’s expected of
you, from elementary school to high school to getting prodded into college
(whether you’ve gone or not), and the prospect of working a 9-to-5 job for
forty years until you can finally spend some time on cruise ships in your
sixties and seventies is, non-negotiably, not an option. Laws and the
government are even worse than all these societal expectations, and you dream
of going somewhere where none of those things can touch you. You want to get
away, you want to live in the country with other people who’ve seen through
the American Dream the way you have. The hippie communes of the ’70s are
where your forerunners went when they figured it out. Out there you can do
what you want, you can smoke and walk around naked and never have to work.
The land offers abundance and you’ll be able to grow your own food and drop
off the grid, to sunder your dependence on the system once and for all, and
live in harmony and community with your brothers and sisters in the only real
sane way to live. 

#### The permaculturalist 

Most of the things that people talk about doing out in the country ring hollow
to you; they sound like continuations, with just slight changes, of the way of
life that’s gotten the planet into its current mess.  Organic farming is
attractive, but it doesn’t go far enough. Instead of repairing the land, it
settles for not doing (much) harm; it relies on the capitalist profit motive
that leads to hierarchicalization and depletion of resources. (And it’s
fighting a losing battle against agribusiness: organic farming sustains itself
by making money, but agribusiness is far more persistent and ruthless in its
pursuit of that money, so organic farming is basically hamstringing itself by
having morals.) 

You’d rather make the world *better,* rather than just stop making it
worse—rebuild the topsoil, reforest the clearcuts, let plants grow to take the
carbon out of the air. And you believe that learning how to do these things is
the best way to get humanity through the future, which will be marked by oil
shortage and shrinking economies. The solution is permaculture, with its small,
simple solutions that encourage everyone to re-localize and rediscover their
neighbors (human and—especially—nonhuman), and don’t depend on massive
infrastructures and centralization. We have to learn how to depend not on the
system, and not on our individual selves, but on our communities.

I’ve made no secret of being a permaculturalist, the last one. When I
describe what I want to do, though, I’m sometimes perplexed at how people
hear it. Often it’s not that they think I’m doing a completely different
thing, it’s just that they assume that the part that resembles their vision
is the main point. Yes, I’ll be growing some vegetables and raising some
animals, but I’m not just doing that because I have a Protestant work
ethic, or because I want to be self-reliant, or because that’s what you
have to do if you’re living where the cops won’t bother you. It’s because I
want to learn new ways of doing all those things with less energy while
improving the soil and the water around me, and then I want to spread those
ideas as far as I can. I want to help build a new society that works with
nature instead of against it.

I’m not saying (at least here) that people with a different focus are all
wrong, I’m just saying that that’s not my focus. That’s why I wrote this: so
that, in the future, when I talk about moving back to the land, I can show
people this and maybe they’ll understand what I’m *actually *talking about,
instead of how it’s a little bit like their own vision.
