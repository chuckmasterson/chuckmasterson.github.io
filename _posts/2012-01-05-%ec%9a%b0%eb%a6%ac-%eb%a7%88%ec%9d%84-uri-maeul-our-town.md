As I said last post, it’s about time I posted a few pictures of the town
I live in. Here they come. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B005.jpg" %}

Before anything else, I must post a picture of the Thanksgiving dinner I
made. I made the potatoes, bread, and chicken. It was delicious.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B004.jpg" %}

This picture was taken at sunrise from the top of Chang’an Mountain
next to Sachangni. The catch is that, since Sachangni is west of the mountain,
this is actually some other village that I’ve never visited.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B010.jpg" %}

This is the least blurry picture I got of the moon during the eclipse.
However, it had just barely started, so none of the moon is visibly shadowed.
And then the failure of this picture made me give up. Instead I enjoyed it
exclusively with my eyes. But I thought it desered commemorating here, even
poorly.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B023.jpg" %}

Here is where I live. This is the back of the house. My room is the one
on the right side of the third floor in the foreground. I’m not really
sure why I didn’t take a picture of the front of the building. Anyhow,
this is one of the nicest places to live in town.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B025.jpg" %}

The school is directly next door. When I got here they were in the middle
of remodeling it—putting in the nice steps out front and the big stage thing.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B027.jpg" %}

It’s laid out as a long corridor. Beyond the end of it in this
picture is where my house is. 


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B026.jpg" %}

Looking the other way down the corridor, there’s another building
not quite connected to the main building, so you have to walk outside to get
from one to the other. This building is where the Sanae English Experience
Center is located.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B095.jpg" %} 

And here we are in the SEEC, which is never referred to by that name.
(It’s the English room.) The computer on the left is where I spend hours
each day.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B096.jpg" %}

This is the back part of the room. It’s only occasionally used.
During English camp, I was urged to make activities that take place in this
part of the room because they make great photographs to show during the
slideshow at the closing ceremony.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B097.jpg" %}

Here is a view in the other direction. There’s a fancy recording
studio set up on the back wall. I’ve never seen it used, not once.
Although there’s a camera hanging from the ceiling that’s been
continuously on since I got here. I’ve tried to figure out how to turn it
off twice now, and each time it gave me an electric shock. Amanda and I
discussed whether this means that it’s actually spy equipment. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B101.jpg" %}

This door is perhaps slightly more weatherproof than the rest of the
doors into the school. That half-inch gap above the doors lets wind in freely.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B099.jpg" %}

Here’s the main hallway of the school. Classrooms on the right
wall, windows on the left, just like a loggia. The windows are single-pane. It
seems that hallways are thought of as extensions of the outdoors, except with
no precipitation. The thing is, the doors into the classrooms aren’t
insulated. They’re made of plastic with a wood veneer. I really
don’t understand the logic that led to these architectural principles. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B100.jpg" %}

The front entrance. Good-bye, please.


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B030.jpg" %}

This is the area right next to the school. In America it would be a lawn,
but here it’s put to practical use; I think during the growing season
they had cabbage here.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B031.jpg" %}

The school is high on a hill, so here’s the road down to the rest
of the town. Coming off the left is a little road to a Buddhist temple, marked
by a swastika.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B032.jpg" %}

This is the temple at the end of that path. It’s just down the hill
from my house. But it’s not the main temple in town; I guess it’s
just an auxiliary, or maybe it’s for civilian Buddhists while the nicer
temple is for soldiers only. At any rate, we’ll get to the other one soon
enough. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B033.jpg" %}

The upstairs of these buildings are occupied by hagwons, a thriving
industry in Korea. They’re places where children can go after school to
study more. They’re not such a big thing with elementary school students,
but I still have quite a few kids who mention that they go to hagwons.
They’re mainly popular with high-schoolers, who must take an exam at the
end of high school that will determine the course of their entire life. The
government recently passed a law that all hagwons must close by 10:00 pm.
Before that, students would study there until perhaps 1:00. Now they study at
home until 1:00.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B035.jpg" %}

Beyond the hagwons, the town peters out and the road goes off to the
mountains and to Seoul. 


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B011.jpg" %}

A little outside town is an old bridge that Sean found while wandering one day.
It looks pretty dilapidated

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B014.jpg" %}

But a swing is slung underneath it: wonderful. Unfortunately, it’s
so close to the ground that you can’t pump your legs with full energy, so
you can’t get up very high at all. Maybe that can be fixed. 


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B036.jpg" %}

Coming down the hill from the school in the other direction, this is the
road that I normally walk when I’m getting into town. People live in this
house; it’s about typical for town.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B037.jpg" %}

This building has a sign that says 인쇄프라자 (*Inswae Peuraja*,
Print Plaza). I’m not sure if it’s even used, but clearly at one
point it was. I had a dream once that soldiers were housed there and I slept in
it with them. It was rickety on the inside too in my dream.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B038.jpg" %}

This is the Dungji Restaurant. They make a mean soft tofu stew. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B039.jpg" %}

The main street in town. Buy the Way and GS25 are everpresent Korean
convenience stores. Also present but not quite as prevalent are 7-Elevens. This
area is mostly restaurants and convenience stores, which are useful for the
soldiers who come into town.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B041.jpg" %}

Here’s a look inside GS25. Of all the pictures I’ve taken in
Korea, this might come closest to summing the place up. We’ve got it all:
pictures of beautiful people, alcohol (in the fridge on the left wall),
packaged goods, the military, cute romance, bad weatherproofing. (However,
missing are: mountains, Buddhism, traditional food, and tradition itself.)

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B040.jpg" %}

Off the main street is the hapkido dojang where I learn. The white door
belongs to it. Next door we have 돼지나라 (Dwaeji Nara)—”Pigland”.
I do not know what kind of business it is. I hope I am right that they sell
pork. In the background you can see the church that’s next door to my
house; it’s built with lots of glass, in the style used when ostentation
is considered important to a building’s design. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B043.jpg" %}

It would be hard to find yourself in any kind of populated place in this
country and be more than a short walk away from a Paris Baguette. Almost
everything they sell is delicious, and some things (like pizza toast and hot
dog pastries) can almost serve as a lunch in a pinch.</p> 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B044.jpg" %}

This is the street where the market is held on calendar days ending in 5
and 0. I’ll make a point of coming back on such a day to get pictures of
the market while it’s happening.  


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B046.jpg" %}

This place sells me fresh whole chickens (생닭—saengdak). They also sell
ducks (오리—ori), which I may have to try sometime.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B047.jpg" %}

Here’s a bank, another example (like the church from earlier) of
the lots-of-glass style of apparently impressive architecture.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B050.jpg" %}

The bus station. This and Ben’s car are the only ways I’ve
ever left Sachangni.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B051.jpg" %}

Nearby, at the bottom of the town, is the entrance from the highway. I
don’t know what the rock says (because it uses old-fashioned Chinese
characters and is thus very hard to translate). But the light-up marquee says,
“If we are prepared for natural disasters, we can overcome them.” I
don’t know why it says that.


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B053.jpg" %}

This is the Sachangcheon; *cheon* is a suffix that means
“stream”.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B054.jpg" %}

Another example of the endearing Korean practice of growing food in every place
where it can be grown.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B056.jpg" caption="Sachangcheon from its
level." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B057.jpg" %}

Across the river is the road up to Chang’an Temple; the trailhead
up Chang’an Mountain is at the temple. On the road we have this place.
Here, I believe, when it’s warmer rabbits are raised for consumption.  

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B058.jpg" %}

And here I believe is the same sort of facility but for dogs. Though
I’m not sure.


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B061.jpg" caption="The beginning of the
trail up the mountain. I didn’t climb it during this walk." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B062.jpg" %}

Instead I went to the temple. These are the steps up to its parking lot. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B063.jpg" caption="The facilities for the
New Year’s Day festivities. The tents were open on the other side and had
four-foot-tall heaters in them." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B064.jpg" caption="The *osaekcheon*
(five-color banners)." %}


{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B091.jpg" %}

This bell isn’t rung just on special occasions. It’s also
rung several times at 5:00 pm every day. I hear it as I walk back to the house
from work. The log is special, though.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B066.jpg" caption="The Buddha watches over
the town." %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B070.jpg" %}

The Buddha stands on a prominence next to the temple. From it you can see
the layout of the whole celebration a little better.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B067.jpg" %}

This is what the Buddha sees.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B069.jpg" %}

On the other side of the prominence is one of many series of tomato
greenhouses where they grow the tomatoes that this tomato town is famous for
tomato tomato. Which is a perfect segue to the tomato park. It is a place that
I did not know existed until a few weeks ago. I can’t explain this fact
well. 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B073.jpg" caption="*Come, walk with me as
we journey through a land of wonder and tomatoes.*" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B080.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B075.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B076.jpg" %} 

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B077.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B078.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B079.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B081.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B082.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B083.jpg" %}

There’s nothing I liked better as a kid than climbing the tomato
tree and plucking myself some nice, juicy, red tomatoes.

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B084.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B085.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Ma%2527eul%2B086.jpg" %} 

As I walked toward this statue, an old man was coming in the opposite
direction. He pointed meaningfully to this statue and to my camera. After I
took a picture, he seemed satisfied.

So that’s it for this. Tomorrow I leave for southeast Asia. Twenty-four
hours from now, I’ll probably be sleeping in Incheon International
Airport. Forty-eight hours from now, I hope I’ll have found a hostel on
Khao San Road in Bangkok. I’ve been staring at computers for probably
more than half my waking day every day for weeks now, so I’m planning to
unplug completely during this trip. This may mean that you have no way of
determining how I’m doing for about three weeks. That may seem extreme,
but I’m going to be doing a lot of traveling in the future, and I think
it may be something that you may have to get used to. I’ll be in Mongolia
for three weeks come September, and there’s no chance that I’ll be
able to log in to Facebook while I’m there, because I’ll be out on
vast plains where the closest thing to an internet cafe will be the scattered
yurts of nomads. Don’t panic. I’m a careful person and I plan on
taking all reasonable measures to ensure that I’m not beaten, mugged, or
otherwise thrown into an undesirable fate. All the countries I’m
traveling in are considered pretty safe, and I’ll mostly be in wild
old-fashioned cities where con artists and lowlifes aren’t drawn, because
all the easy marks are to be found in Bangkok and Hanoi and such places. It may
be possible for me to note quickly once a week that I’m fine, but if it
doesn’t happen, just consider no news to be good news.

And incidentally, I am going to have *so much fun.* I’ll tell you
all about it.
