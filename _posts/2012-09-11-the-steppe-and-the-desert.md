Before we jump all the way to Ulaanbaatar, I want to spend a few moments at the
Dakgalbi and Makguksu Festival. This was the last interesting thing I did in
Korea. Chuncheon, about 40 minutes away from Sachangni and the birthplace of
both dakgalbi (chicken stir-fry stuff) and makguksu (cold buckwheat noodles
with vegetables and stuff), puts on a festival to honor them every year. You
might wonder what kind of events there could be at a festival designed
specifically to honor just two foods. Well, the answer is Korean ingenuity,
which figured out quite a few things to do, most of them only tangentially
related to dakgalbi or makguksu. There was the chicken fight, for instance. Two
contestants, chosen from a crowd, stand in a big kiddie pool maybe fifteen feet
in diameter. They each put on a ridiculous chicken hat, stand on one leg (the
other leg maybe looks like a chicken wing?), and run into each other repeatedly
to knock the other one over.

Or alternatively, there’s the South American music show, which has
nothing to do with anything, but there it was. There were four guys who I think
were all from Ecuador, with flutes and panpipes and face paint, and they played
native-style music. I met one of them, Crístian, and also the Korean manager of
the act, Diego, before they started playing. So I spoke a bunch of Spanish,
which I wasn’t expecting, and it was a mind-bender after turning all my
thought patterns backwards for the past year. Crístian only spoke Spanish and I
think some English, but Diego spoke Korean, Spanish (on account of working in
an almond factory in Guatemala for about two years), and English (once
you’ve learned one language, the rest come easily…), and we talked
in all three, and I got all confused in the most interesting-feeling way. We
talked a lot about the stuff we’ve done and the stuff we’re going
to do. And Crístian gave me a totem for my journeys. It’s a little clay
ocarina that plays seven notes of a major scale; it’s turtle-shaped and
two inches long and has a hand-painted sun on it, and goes on a cord around my
neck.

I wore it every day for several days, then left it behind at a hostel, but now
I’ve got it again. I wore it to the airport in Seoul, though I put it in
my shoe while I slept on a wooden bench near the food court the night before my
flight left. And I put it on the next morning when I took my flights to China
and to Ulaanbaatar. As the plane came down toward the city, I could see through
the clear sky of the day to what I was going to be getting into. I liked it
immediately: the Mongolian countryside was endless, fenceless, and empty except
for haphazardly laid roads and scatterings of gers. When we’d gotten
pretty close, I managed to make out a herd of sheep. What a country.

Ulaanbaatar, though, seemed a bit less appealing. The main thing I saw when we
were coming in was a giant power plant with a smokestack probably hundreds of
feet high. The airport seemed like the kind of place that’s only open
once or twice a week, when someone calls in to the manager on his home phone
and tells him that some foreigners are coming and they can’t figure out
how to land the plane on the empty steppe. I regretfully had to leave behind a
group of Spanish biologists I’d met in Beijing, who were going to the
wilderness to study bears and wolves and leopards (snow leopards?) and seemed
extremely jolly and hardy, because they were going to be away for an entire
month.

So I got myself a taxi to town. The taxi driver kind of ripped me off, I think,
but it was okay, because on the way he handed me a little 50mL bottle of
something called _arkhi_, which turned out to be a lot like whisky, and pretty
enjoyable; I was encouraged to take a swig in the car. We passed lots of
billboards for mining equipment and investment in mining. And also a little
herd of cows by the side of the road, along with their herder. Just kind of
casually grazing.

My guesthouse was down a back alley and had graffiti on the walls, but inside
it was welcoming enough, if not exactly luxurious. The couch in the common room
takes up half its floor space. Mongolia is a land of wide open spaces, but not
inside Ulaanbaatar. I didn’t dwell much on it, though, because I had an
appointment to keep: I was visiting [Lauren
Knapp](http://laurenknapp.wordpress.com/), who graduated from Grinnell a few
years ago and then came to Ulaanbaatar on a Fulbright Scholarship to write
about Mongolian contemporary music. As such, we were meeting at Ikh Mongol
(“Great Mongol”), a classy restaurant near the State Department Store. I had a
few extra minutes, so I stepped inside the State Department Store to look
around. I only looked at the first floor, but it’s a weird place. It’s like a
mall, except all shuffled together. You enter through what looks like a
JCPenney, but then if you keep going straight there’s a little stairway and a
swinging gate and you’re in a grocery store section. Next to the grocery store,
just through a doorway, is something that seems like the kitchenware section of
Walmart. When I got back out again, it was raining and I was late, so I jogged
to Ikh Mongol.

Lauren had along two friends—another Grinnellian from her year or so, and a
girl she’d met somewhere else. That girl, Sarah, turned out to be from
Cincinnati, which blew us both away. We all talked a bunch about Mongolia and
the weird circumstances that brought us all here. Then the band got ready to
play. They’re Lauren’s favorite and one of the most popular in the
country: Altan Urag (“Golden Generation”). She explained them to
us: they play traditional Mongolian instruments, like a two-string horsehead
fiddle (instead of the traditional horse’s head carving, they opted for
alien heads), and something that looks like a clarinet but sounds like a
frantic trumpet, and something else that looks like a hammer dulcimer. Their
backup singer does throat singing. But they play it all in a totally modernized
way. They started playing. It was the _Pirates of the Caribbean_ theme—yet,
instead of being cheesy, it was amazing, because of the sheer hard energy they
put into it, and because the Mongolian instruments made it sound like nothing
I’ve heard before, and because they’re just an incredible band. The
next song was the best one, and I have it on video and I’ll put it up
someday, though I’d wager Lauren also has it on her site somewhere (but I
don’t know its name). The throat singer sang the whole thing, and when he
sang the wordless melody, I couldn’t explain how he made it sound like
his voice was whistling. I’d forgotten what music could sound like when
it had spirit. This was a hell of a good reintroduction.

Lauren was leaving soon and she’d just had a going-away party, so she was
exhausted and left me to my own devices for the rest of the night while she and
the other two went elsewhere. So I headed to my hostel and slept. The next day
I woke up and commenced not knowing what to do. Ulaanbaatar is Earth’s
local franchise of purgatory. You can’t really do independent traveling
in Mongolia like you can in other countries, because there’s not really
such a thing as public transportation. What you have to do is rent a van, and
also a driver, and since that’s a lot of money, you also need a few other
people to split it among. So you have to go around all the guesthouses and
check their bulletin boards and email people and hang out in the common rooms.
I did this for a day and a half, and if I hadn’t realized that I needed
to be more proactive, it could’ve easily ballooned to three or four.
Karine, a French girl who put me in touch with the people I’d eventually
go on a tour with, wasn’t very proactive, and I think she ended up
staying in Ulaanbaatar the entire time she was in Mongolia. It’s a hard
place to get out of. And all you do there is waste time, because there’s
not much to see. A nice square, a few monasteries and monuments, and then
you’re pretty much done with Ulaanbaatar.

I met a Polish-British guy named Kyle and we found the traveling group that
Karine had mentioned to me, which was: John and Crystal, an Australian couple
(John reminds me of Uncle Dan in his ability to call things like they are and
put up with no bullshit but in a funny way); Audrey, an Australian who does
ballet and is also more stressed than she realizes; Jenna, a Canadian who was
quiet for several days but then started reading her journal entries to us,
which revealed that her degree in writing was well earned; Kyle, who’s
goofy and highly sarcastic and livens things up; and Rüdiger, a German guy who
said he understood about 20% of what we were saying, but managed to be
hilarious whenever he chimed in (perhaps because of the accent) and served as a
sort of conversation redirector, who would occasionally take a topic that had
been going on too long, misunderstand what we were saying about it, and route
it into a new topic. The guesthouse we were using set us up with a driver named
Jackie, but his van crapped out about a half hour into the trip, just as we had
gotten outside the city. So we looked at the thick brown envelope of smog
we’d all been living in for the last few days (it was unbelievable) until
another van arrived. Jackie couldn’t drive this one because it belonged
not to the guesthouse but to its driver, named Boogii (pronounced like
“bawg-ee”, not “boogie”). He didn’t speak fluent
English (neither did Jackie), but he spoke plenty enough to get by, and we had
some interesting conversations with him all during the trip. And so, with our
complement of seven and Boogii, we headed out into the steppe.

There are a few things that make the steppe the steppe. The first one, and the
most salient one, is its infinitude. For practical purposes, Mongolia has one
city, Ulaanbaatar where 70 percent of the population lives, and everywhere
outside of that is empty. Once you get outside the city, and you can no longer
see the disgusting brown haze that completely envelops it, you can stand
anywhere, turn 360 degrees, and see nothing but horizon. There are no trees, no
bushes taller than your knee, in many places no hills or deviations from
complete flatness, and quite often no buildings. Though there is actually not
too bad a chance that somewhere before the horizon you’ll see a ger. They
seem less like buildings and more like natural growths of the landscape, like
the spores on a fern frond. I believe looking that far and seeing nothing was
completely new for me. I can’t think of where I might have done it
before. Now I could do it for horizon after horizon. The only things in sight
were the road, the inside of the van, and mile after mile of tufts of grass and
other plants no more ambitious than ankle level. If there was a ger, perhaps it
would be accompanied by a herd of cows, or horses, or sheep, or goats.
That’s it.

But the vastness is the thing you’d already be expecting, going out into
country Mongolia for the first time. Not that it wouldn’t still surprise
you, because even though you’d know it’s vast, you couldn’t
be prepared for just how vast. But there are other things you wouldn’t
even have guessed at. One is the smell. The first time the van stopped, I
stepped out into a stiff wind and took a deep breath, and there was an
unmistakable scent to it, surprisingly definite, not like a vague, shifting
collection of faint smells, more like something you’d drink as an herbal
tea. For the first few days of the trip into the steppe, I looked around for
the plant that was responsible. I don’t know why it took me so long,
since the stuff is actually everywhere, but I finally found it. It has lacy
triangle-inspired leaves and hard stalks that sprout out yellow ball-shaped
flowers. I asked Boogii what it was called, and he thought for a moment and
told me: _агь_ (pronounced “aig”). This turns out to be wormwood,
the same stuff they use to make absinthe. It’s hard to describe a smell,
but maybe you could say it’s somewhere between chamomile and cilantro.
Every time I was outside, it was there to greet me. It was interesting to
realize that the steppe must have smelled like this for millions of years. An
eternal smell.

And another thing you don’t know about beforehand is the strange
distortion of time that happens there. Boogii told us that in the city, and in
other countries, there are twenty-four hours, but in the Mongolian countryside,
there are two: morning, and afternoon. Night doesn’t count as a third
hour, because everyone’s asleep. When you do run into people out there,
they are supremely unhurried people. Nomadic Mongolians must have more free
time than practically anyone else on the planet. What is there to do? Have a
bit of breakfast. Get on your horse and herd some animals around, if they need
herding. Make some lunch. Sit around and talk. Watch the clouds, because you
probably don’t have a TV, or even electricity. Make some dinner. As a
consequence, the pace of our trip was something that took some getting used to.
Our first lunch was at a square building, near a few gers but otherwise
completely alone in an expanse of nowhere, and we were a bit surprised to find
out that it would take an hour for the food to be ready. That turned out to be
one of our quicker meals, actually. I think it might have been a bit ahead of
schedule. Most of the meals took more like an hour and a half. We got used to
this.

The culture has come to perfectly fit itself to the pace of the steppe. On our
second, or maybe third, day, Boogii got lost, understandable given the complete
lack of landmarks, aside from the occasional rock cairn draped with strips of
blue cloth, Buddhist prayer flags. He turned off the dirt road we were on and
started driving across the trackless flatness in search of anyone. After a
while, he found a guy on horseback, wearing a traditional Mongolian _deel_ coat
and herding around his other horses, and he drove up to him to ask where to go.
On a city street this would be as brief as possible: “How do you get to
Battery Park?” “Go that way on this street until it ends, turn
right, then turn left again at Hudson.” But out in the steppe, quite
sensibly, it became a leisurely sort of abbreviated version of a home visit. I
couldn’t understand the Mongolian they were speaking, but the way it
sounded, Boogii asked how the guy was doing, and if his horses were getting
along well, and the guy told him yes, everything was going pretty well, though
it might be nice if there were a little rain, and Boogii said of course, and
asked how his family was, and the guy said they were all doing alright, and his
daughter would be visiting next month, and Boogii said that was nice, and by
the way, how do you get to the little town nearby with the old ruined
monasteries by it? and the guy said you just drive southwest a bit and
you’ll find another driving path and that’ll take you there, and
Boogii said that’s nice of you, thanks, and is your daughter bringing her
boyfriend when she comes over, or doesn’t she have one? and they
continued in this way for several minutes.

Since visits are so few and far between, any visit is occasion for a long chat
and asking for any news there might be from other parts. And it’s
unthinkable to refuse a visit. There’s a hard rule of country Mongolia,
and it’s that if anyone stops by your ger and needs dinner and a place to
sleep, you can’t refuse them. Every ger is a potential motel and
restaurant. If you have horses, you make _airag_ (fermented mare’s milk,
about 3 percent alcohol), and keep a stock of it ready for anyone who happens
by for a visit. If you pass a ger, without even knowing the person who lives
there, you can just stop and ask for a bit of _airag_ and a chat, and
you’ll get it. This happened to us on one of our days, actually; Boogii
saw some horses and asked if we’d like to try _airag_, and so he called
in on an old lady and a young lady who lived there, and we all sat in their ger
while they smiled and poured a bowl for Boogii, a bowl that we all shared sips
from, and then another bowl for Boogii. 

Shortly after this, Crystal was sick behind a nearby smaller, ancillary ger. We
found this pretty funny. Then as we drove on toward our next destination, she
told us there was more going on than just that. Her eyelids were swelling up,
and her throat was slowly closing. We had Boogii stop and let her try to get it
out of her system, but she couldn’t throw up any more, and Boogii
cottoned on that she had an allergy and offered to take us to a hospital.
Excellent idea. The hospital was about 20km away, but the steppe magnifies all
distances. You can only drive very slowly here through all the pits and bumps
in the roadway—there are hardly any paved roads in this whole country, only
dirt tire tracks smoothed out a little bit by frequent use. There were two or
three valleys between us and the hospital, so we couldn’t see it while we
went through these valleys, and it seemed like it could be imaginary. After
all, how could Boogii know there was a hospital there? We hadn’t seen a
hospital all trip long. Meanwhile Crystal’s eyes had swollen completely
shut, her face was ballooning, and her throat was closing more and more, never
less like we kept hoping, and no amount of water that John told her to keep
drinking would help. He was terrific in the circumstances, asking her about her
throat and everything to monitor the reaction and keep her in the moment.
Boogii was absolutely intent. Those minutes were more intense and suspenseful
than any action movie.

The town of Khujirt appeared, the biggest town we’d seen all trip by far,
and within minutes we got to their clean, more or less modern hospital and they
took care of her and gave her IV drips and pills and everything. The whole
thing took two hours and the rest of us had drinks at a cafe that called itself
a pub but had no beer, and we just kind of slowly let all the pressure lift
itself off us.

But this has all been general stuff, mixed with a few little anecdotes. I meant
to tell you one story, so I’m going to finally get around to that. This
is the story of the fourth day, which I think was easily the best day. Boogii
got us up in the morning and we had our standard breakfast of coffee, bread,
jam, and whatever else he’d scrounged up at the latest food store, maybe
pâté or sausage. Then we drove, but for far less time than we had on
previous days, when we mostly got up in the morning and reached our destination
around dinnertime, leaving little time to do much exploring or spending
time seeing the sights we’d come to see. On this day we arrived at about
2:00 to a collection of gers out in the desert. In most places, the Gobi
isn’t like the sort of desert you’d picture, shifting sand dunes
and expanses of nothing but sand. There are plants in the Gobi, though
low-growing ones, and it’s also almost completely flat everywhere. But
here it looked a bit more like the Sahara sort of image you get when you think
“desert”. These gers were sitting at the bottom of a big dune, not
right up next to it, but about a camel ride’s distance away. And
coincidentally, there were also a bunch of camels there. This was our agenda
for the afternoon.

Audrey had ridden a camel before and didn’t like it, so she went to the
dune solo on foot, but the rest of us each picked out a camel from a group that
a hardy old lady led over to us. The camels all dutifully sat down and let us
get on, and the man of the ger, Nyamka, chained them all together using
camel-hair ropes fastened to homemade wooden bits pierced through their noses.
His own camel was in front. Crystal and Jenna got camels that could walk on
their own, which was nice for them because they didn’t have to worry
about getting their left legs covered with the shit of the camel in front of
them like I did, although Crystal was a bit less excited about it when her
camel decided following the other camels was boring and it would be much more
fun to stop and eat some plants. Nyamka always made sure hers caught up,
though. Riding a camel was completely new for me. I don’t even remember
when I’d ridden a horse before this day, and that’s way more
normal. Camels are bigger and have more flexible necks and more alarming
mouths, and they have humps. I was sitting between the two humps. People give
camel riding a bad rap for its discomfort, but I actually thought it was pretty
nice. So all the camels plodded along, up and down with each pace, and
occasionally scratching their noses on the pants of the person on the next
camel in front, or shitting lavishly. To run the risk of stating the obvious,
they were so much more _alive_ than anything else I’d ridden, since
I’d only ever ridden machines. I can see how, doing this, you’d get
a real sense of kinship with the animals. I didn’t, as such, since I was
more concerned with avoiding camel shit on the left and camel snot on the right
(avoiding these turned out to be impossible), but I got a feel of it, and I
liked it.

Nyamka dropped us off at the very foot of the dune. It was cold: we were in the
shade, and nighttime was coming on, and it’s getting to be fall in
Mongolia, land of some of the harshest winters around. (Ulaanbaatar is the
coldest capital city in the world.) But here we were at this sand dune, and
what else was there to do but climb up it? Everyone gave it a go. The dune was
way taller than it looked. Not only the steppe magnifies distance—the dunes do
too. And also, sand isn’t good for climbing. It causes you to slip
backward half a step for each step you take. We all took several breaks for
catching our breath and swearing vividly. Crystal and John turned back partway
up, figuring they’d gotten the idea. That left me, Kyle, Jenna, and
Rüdiger to claim the top. So we powered on, and claim it we did.

The wind was beyond anything I think I’ve known before. Maybe it
wasn’t actually the fastest I’ve felt, but what it was was full of
sand. All of it blowing in hard swirls and eddies that all seemed to direct
themselves right into my face. I squinted out at the other side: dunes, dunes,
dunes, all of them smaller than the one I was on, but stretching out, as so
many things do in this country, to the edge of vision. Kyle and Rüdiger showed
up and looked out, and so did Jenna, but none of us said much because sand
would have gotten in our mouths. Then we universally agreed that it was time to
climb down.

Jenna and Rüdiger took the safe way, switchbacking down the way we’d come
up, approximately. Kyle and I went directly for the steepest section, pitched
at some absurd angle like sixty degrees. At this angle, every step was as good
as three or four, or maybe ten. There was the initial step, and then there was
the sand giving way for several feet underneath that step, until I had dug in
deep enough to stop. Apparently, when people dream of flying they dream it in
several different ways; John and Jenna and I found this out one night while we
were talking. John has certain places in the world where he can fly, and Jenna
can fly by jumping off of high places. But when I fly, it’s by running
faster and faster until I take off. Each pace gets longer and longer until
I’m in the air for several seconds at a time, dozens of feet per stride,
and finally I realize I don’t need to touch the ground after all. Running
down the sand dune was the only time I’ve felt like that was happening in
real life.

Once I woke up by hitting the bottom of the dune and walking back to camp
thoroughly exhausted, I found there was yet more in store for us tonight. For
one thing, tonight, Nyamka would be branding a few of this year’s foals
that he hadn’t branded yet. He did this before dinnertime and we all came
out to watch. All the foals were tied up to a rope strung between two short
logs hammered into the ground; so were their mothers, I think. He picked out
the smallest foal first, and Boogii came over to help him. Nyamka grabbed the
foal by its neck and wrestled it for a while, then got the right grip on
it—right hand around its neck, left hand grabbing onto some skin on its
belly—and then he lifted the whole foal off the ground, turned it over in
mid-air, and landed it in a lying-down position on the ground. Now he kept a
leg on it so it couldn’t get up, and he and Boogii tied its strong,
flailing legs all together with a piece of rope, hobbling it. What an utter
mass of muscle Nyamka was. And he was middle-aged. With that foal stabilized,
he picked out a bigger one and wrestled it down the same way. Meanwhile, the
hardy old lady from before had been heating the brand in a pile of dried horse
dung, and by now it was good and hot. Nyamka got a mouthful of water from a
dirty bucket and took the brand over to the first foal. Carefully, he chose a
spot and pressed the brand deliberately against the foal’s skin for
several seconds, then took it off and spat the cold water all over the burn.
The foal hardly even flinched. I was amazed. He branded the second foal, then
untied them both, and neither one went on a kicking rampage. They were calm,
almost, no different except that they were sporting a new design on their
flanks. (Picture this shape, all connected together, and turned 90 degrees
clockwise so the flat side is pointed up: **<span style="font-family:
Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">D-[</span>**.)

He branded one more the same way, and then it was time to make dinner. The
first step to that was to kill the goat. I didn’t realize a goat was
being killed until some of the others came in and told me Nyamka had just
killed it, but I came right away outside and saw John helping Nyamka carry it
over to his ger. John and I both helped him cut it up. John stabilized it for a
little while at the beginning while Nyamka cut its skin away, but I spent a bit
longer, holding onto its front legs while he cut it open and pulled out each of
its organs. The stomach was enormous, probably accounted for half the volume of
its innards. Maybe that’s to do with how it’s a grass-eater. The
cavity started filling with blood, which he scooped up with a bowl and emptied
into a bigger bowl in order to make blood sausages later. After he got each
piece of meat off, he laid it on top of his ger. He was highly efficient. While
he was cutting it apart, I thought I could feel its nerves still humming under
my fingers. It was weird, unforgettable.

Nyamka kept most of the meat, since a whole goat is a bit much for all of us
for one night. But we did have some of its ribs in our soup that night. It was
pretty much the shortest supply chain that any food I’ve eaten has ever
had. I went to bed feeling highly satisfied with the day.

There are other stories, but I’m coming to realize that if I try to tell
all my stories here, I’ll spend half my journey blogging. This blog is
the result of hours and hours on hostel computers, and keep in mind
that’s in a city that’s Purgatory on Earth, where I often have
nothing to do for hours. Since the trip I’ve taken a 2½-day walking trip
where I stayed on my own with genuine nomadic families not pimped by any
tourism agency, and been given absolutely fresh milk, yogurt, and butter by
them. Tomorrow I intend to get on the train to Irkutsk, or head north somehow
or other. And so I’ll continue. I’ll update again whenever I have a
chance, but I can’t guarantee anything. That’s just how I like it.
