I bike through the University of Minnesota on my regular commute. The commute has gotten noticeably more fun since I realized something about the U’s school colors.

Now when I ride through campus, past students in their red and gold scarves, I shout (privately to myself, and in the voice of the Sorting Hat), “<span class="small-caps">Gryffindor</span>!!”

Since this blog isn't ready for primetime yet, I'm going to use this post to test out syntax highlighting:

``` c#
public class Whatever
{
    public static string foo = bar;
    public static int hah = 1;
    public static string widdershins { get; set; }
}
return null;
```

Stuff should look okay when it comes afterwards too.
