I bike through the University of Minnesota on my regular commute. The commute has gotten noticeably more fun since I realized something about the U’s school colors.

Now when I ride through campus, past students in their red and gold scarves, I shout (privately to myself, and in the voice of the Sorting Hat), “<span class="small-caps">Gryffindor</span>!!”
