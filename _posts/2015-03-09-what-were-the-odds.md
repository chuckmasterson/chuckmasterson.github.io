Looking around my life for romantic interests, I realized I’d practically
specialized myself right out of the market. Who was I hoping to find? A natural
spirit, a forager, someone else who daydreams of dropping off the grid with a
community of friends; someone to dumpster-dive and explore abandoned buildings
with;&nbsp;someone to walk beside barefoot in the forest to go climb trees and
rocks; someone to one day hitchhike and hop trains with; someone
whose&nbsp;mind travels along the same unorthodox lines as mine. Someone
unattainable, basically. But then I found her.

I met Misty gradually. We talked a little at a couple of Potluck
Jams, about names and nature and things. But we met more definitively at an
event that I don’t think could possibly be more Midwestern, the Monday
night square dance at the Eagles’ Club. We didn’t get much chance
to talk while we were swingin’ our partners ’round, but afterwards
I found her because I remembered her from before, and we got to talking, and we
discovered that we both loved climbing stuff. So a few days later, late on a
cold weekday night, we met by a light rail station and crept together into the
old grain silos by the switchyards. We explored all the places I’d been
to, and squeezed into new cracks and buildings, and collected old machinery
labels and extremely purple powder. (The purplest stuff of any kind I’ve
seen in my whole life.)

As first dates go, it was pretty untraditional, but that’s exactly the
point—neither of us would have wanted anything different, and we knew it, and
from there it snowballed. A few nights later we went rock climbing (she’s
a terrific climber) and told each other stories about our lives. And that
weekend we rode out to St Paul and watched the annual Vulcan Victory parade,
which celebrates the inevitable overthrow of the king of winter, with the
appropriate use of huge gouts of flame from hot-air-balloon engines, and was
followed by a giant fireworks display over the icy Mississippi. We came back
together to my house and talked about how great a time we’d been having
and how many even greater things we’d already thought of that we would
both love to do together, and that sealed it. That was last month, and so far
we’re still having more fun together than I would’ve dared to hope
for. She’s taken me dancing, I’ve written her into my
journal’s Imaginary Week, we’ve climbed around atop frozen
waterfalls, and we’ve got better and better plans coming down the
pipeline.

So if I seem a little more euphoric than usual lately, now you know why.
