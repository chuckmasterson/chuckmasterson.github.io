Oh hello. The other day a guy from Korea Telecom came over to my apartment and
at long last hooked me up with a reliable internet connection. This means that
I can finally upload all the photos that I’ve taken over the last month.
Remember, you can click on any one and see it far larger.

* * *

Let’s start off with a few photos that I took in more or less random
directions when I got into Seoul. I thought it’d be a good idea to get
pictures of what the general feel of the city is like, since every city looks a
little bit different. So here’s a flavor of Seoul:

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 062.jpg" %}

This street is not typical. Most of the time, there’s no empty space on
the roadway. I think this was an abnormally spacious district.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 060.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 059.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 057.jpg" %}

Some of us just took a walk around our neighborhood to try and find a
bookstore, and on our way we happened upon this. It’s not the sort of
thing one is likely to see in, say, Davenport.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 069.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 070.jpg" %}

Walking in unplanned directions, we happened by the neighborhood artificial leg
shop.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 072.jpg" %}

I wanted to take a picture of just this traditional carving, but there was
modern stuff all around it, and I realized it would have to be a picture that
shows the juxtaposition between the deep old culture of Korea and the
streamlined, commercial culture it has in the modern era.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 073.jpg" %}

This is a 노래방 (norae-bang, literally “song-room”).

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 074.jpg" %}

It was the first I had seen, but finding them is not a challenge. Here is what
you do in a norae-bang. First, you and your friends go out to several bars and
get very drunk on bad beer and 소주 (soju), a traditional Korean potato liquor
that tastes like vodka cut with acetone. Beer must be a relatively new thing in
Korea, because they have definitely not figured out how to do it right yet.
There are two main brands in Korea, Hite and Cass, which you drink because
anything imported costs eight or nine dollars a glass. They taste mostly like
beer, but also unsettlingly of chemicals. Interestingly enough, Ben told me
today that he’s had North Korean soju, and it tastes miles
better—it’s the sort of thing that you pour into a wine glass and sip
convivially, rather than pounding a shot of it and trying to get the taste to
go away as soon as you can. He figures this is because there’s probably
still some poor old lady making it by hand, as opposed to however Korea has
figured out to industrialize it. Anyhow, the second step in the norae-bang
process is that you enter the norae-bang, buy more drinks, and then get a small
room with a big screen and a couple books of song names like they have for
karaoke in America. You all sing your favorite songs really loud and drunkenly,
and all your friends applaud you and make fun of you, and around 4 in the
morning, you all stumble home and collapse into heaps.  

The norae-bang is staffed, improbably, by a middle-aged lady, who apparently
earns her living by staying up all night and selling alcohol and renting out
rooms here. You’d think the economic demand for these would support maybe
one per neighborhood in a big city like Seoul, and if you were from a small
town, why, you’d just have to go to Seoul if you felt like some
norae-banging. However, the reality is that in Sachangni, population about
5,000, there are at least three norae-bangs. Korean economics will probably
always remain a mystery to me.

Here’s a view of a small part of metropolitan Seoul across the Han River.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 078.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 082.jpg" caption="Rice paddy on Ganghwa
island." %}

Next to the rice paddy was this house with a very nice garden out front—they
were growing hot peppers, but I don’t think those show in this
picture—and I thought, “I’d better take a picture of this
traditional house with its garden.” Because we were about to do
traditional sedge mat making, I figured we were in a traditional village sort
of thing. Later I found out that, besides the cool roof, most of the houses in
Sachangni seem to look a lot like this. Everyone has a garden. I don’t
think I’ve seen a yard, in the American sense, since I got in the
country.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 084.jpg" %}

These are the spools with which one makes traditional sedge mats. At the top
you can see the four stalks they started me out with.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 086.jpg" %}

Allegedly if you work at it for a long time, you can make amazing things like
this mat, but since we only had about two hours, all of ours were about like
the one hanging on its right side.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 087.jpg" %}

Here’s the dolmen that I mentioned in one of my earlier posts.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 091.jpg" %}

Around the authentic dolmen were some recreations of other old things, Korean
and not. I think this moai was made in France.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 092.jpg" %}

And this, apparently, is what Koreans used to live in about five thousand years
ago.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 093.jpg" %}

Here are squashes being grown in what I have to assume is the traditional way.
But not *that* traditional, because squash is native to the Americas. They
probably didn’t start growing it here until the 1900s.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 095.jpg" %}

This is a palace grounds we visited, also on Ganghwa Island. The palace
isn’t there anymore, but its outbuildings are. I think this one was an
archive.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 099.jpg" %}


This seems to be what went on in this particular outbuilding of the
old palace, except in the old days the people weren’t made of wax.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 103.jpg" %}


Where the palace used to be, they put a wonderful flower garden.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 097.jpg" %}

The level of detail in the decoration of this roof floored me. Later I found
out that every fancy old building in Korea has a roof like this.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 100.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 101.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 102.jpg" %}

I don’t know where they found the time, but then, Koreans have never been
afraid to tackle impossibly monumental projects.  To name just two: the
Tripitaka Koreana and the Hyundai shipyard.  The first one is a series of
81,258 engraved woodblocks from the 1200s with the texts of the Buddhist
*Tripitaka* (sacred texts) on them, millions of characters in all. Each
woodblock was carved by a master carver over the course of several days, and
the entire project took 16 years to complete. No one has yet found an error in
them. They’re so well made and preserved against the elements by such
rigorous treatments that they’re still used to print copies of the
Buddhist texts today.  

They Hyundai shipyard was unlikely, to say the least. The man behind it, Chung
Yu-jung, had been working on cars and civil engineering, and had become a
fairly successful businessman. Then he decided that shipbuilding should be the
way of the future. He had never built a ship before, nor had anyone in Korea
really. But he proposed the following idea to several big shipping powers: he
would build the largest ship in the world. After getting laughed at for a
while, he finally got a yes and a lot of money from one government, but under
the condition that he had to build the ship in five years.  Unfortunately, he
had no shipyard. So he hired lots and lots of men to build the shipyard—and
also build the ship *at the same time*. They worked sixteen hours a day
and slept on site. They finished the ship, and the shipyard, *two years ahead
of schedule.* 

At the top of Seoul, there is a tower where you can climb up and look out at
the whole city.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 120.jpg" %}

There was a two-hour wait to go up, but down on the ground I was still at the
top of Seoul, just not the manmade tippy-top.  So I still saw the whole city.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 116.jpg" %}

At the bottom of the tower, there’s a boardwalk where you can look out.
Of course there’s a railing all the way around the boardwalk. When a
couple in Seoul decides they’re in it for the long haul, they come up to
Seoul Tower and make out for a long time on the boardwalk. Then they take a
padlock, write their love on it, attach it to the railing, and throw the key
over the edge. The result is this: thousands and thousands of padlocks.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 121.jpg" %}

Recognizing that the tower was the most romantic place in Seoul, someone
created this monument to romance and put it there.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 123.jpg" %}

Here I show how adept I am at goofy poses.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 128.jpg" %}

But my friends Alex and Cody are even better. Alex (left) wasn’t even
trying.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 131.jpg" %}

After the orientation in Seoul, some of us found ourselves in the town of
Sachangni, these people of course being my new friends.  Here’s what
Sachangni looks like from our apartment house.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 144.jpg" %}

After we’d gotten to Sachangni and settled in a bit, we took a trip to
nearby Chuncheon. This picture shows where I had 닭갈비 (dakgalbi) for the
first time. I cannot recommend this food highly enough. It’s a simple
concept: chicken stir-fried with cabbage, rice logs, some more vegetables that
vary by restaurant, and magical sauce. But simple as it is, it’s up there
among my favorite foods ever. I don’t know how they make it taste that
good. I also don’t know if you can find it in the US—if you can, it must
be difficult—but when I come back I’m going to make it all the time. You
may have noticed there are a lot of restaurants in this picture, and wondered
which one I ate the dakgalbi at. The answer is I don’t know, because
every one of these is a dakgalbi restaurant. Chuncheon is the home of dakgalbi,
and this is its Dakgalbi Street, an entire alley at least a block long that has
only one kind of establishment—dakgalbi restaurants. Furthermore, this is only
one of at least three dakgalbi streets in Chuncheon, although I believe it is
the only one that has exclusively dakgalbi.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 142.jpg" %}

P.S. It can be made with tofu, so you can try it too, Dan.

Next a few pictures from our ascent of 창안산 (Chang-an Mountain). This gazebo
near the base is likely where I’ll hang out a lot after I get a bike
that I can use to cross town quickly and before it gets too cold to stay
outside all the time.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 145.jpg" %}

Russell, working out on some of the exercise inexplicably placed on this
mountain hiking trail, where I guess they thought people weren’t getting
enough exercise.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 146.jpg" %}

Look closely and you can see Sean climbing up this rock slope. There was an
alternative path up the mountain that didn’t make you climb rocks, but
that’s for sissies.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 147.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 150.jpg" caption="Russell at the peak." %}

I want to say this is a panorama of Sachangni from atop Chang-an, but actually
I’m pretty sure this is the town on the other side of Chang-an. But you
get the general idea.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 152.jpg" %}

Near the peak we found a couple of these ramshackle huts, whose purpose we
couldn’t work out. We figured it probably had something to do with North
Korea and our being 12 miles from the DMZ.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 153.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 154.jpg" caption="Amanda and Russell on the
descent." %}

I thought Deb might be interested to know we have fire-bellied toads here.  

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 155.jpg" %}

Our descent took us around a rice paddy and then to the river at the bottom of
town.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 157.jpg" %}

A garden of 깻잎 (kkaennip), which is one of the two leaves you can choose to
wrap your dakgalbi in (the other is lettuce).  (It’s also one of the few
Korean words that’s not spelled phonetically—for some reason it’s
spelled *kkaes-ip*.)

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 158.jpg" %}

Amanda loves a man in uniform, and at Sachangni’s military 
festival, she had plenty of them to choose from.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 162.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 169.jpg" %}

When Korea puts on a festival, it doesn’t mess around. In America no town
of 5,000 people could ever muster the energy to put up a stage like this.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 163.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 167.jpg" %}

Or a fireworks show like this.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 175.jpg" %}

Lastly, a few from our trip to Nami Island. Here: please contemplate if the
words “Instant Fish Paste” can describe any possible edible thing.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 183.jpg" %}

Here we are at the top of the tower that serves as the beginning point of the
zipline onto Nami Island.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 184.jpg" %}

At last a picture of everyone’s faces, instead of all the backs of heads
that I usually seem to photograph. This was taken by the zipline operator and
it features, from left to right: half of me, Russell, Sean, Amanda, Deanna, and
Ben.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 185.jpg" %}

When we landed, it turned out that Nami Island is ruled by ostriches.  Deanna
unwittingly insulted this one and was subject to a stern reprimand.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 188.jpg" %}

Sean, however, made friends with them. But ostriches can be aloof, and refused
to pose for this photograph.

{% include fig.html src="Waaait 189.jpg" %}

That’s all I have for now. I’ll keep taking them, though.
