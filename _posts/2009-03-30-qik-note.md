On my way back to Grinnell, I saw  
- A place called “Qik N EZ”.  
- A truck that had skidded partially off the road and was blocking one lane.  
- A truck from the Batesville Casket Company that said on the back, “Please
  drive safely -- Heaven can wait”. I wanted to take a picture, but I couldn’t
  get to my camera from up in the front.
