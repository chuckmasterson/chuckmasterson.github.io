- In the sky and the ocean
- Around its eternal dance
- Water abides slow-motion
- But waits for the rare chance
^
- To savor the thrill of the *drip*---
- Which rarely, even when found
- Lasts longer than the short trip
- From cloud to (already?) ground.
^
- But some days, some lucky drops
- Manage to lengthen the tickle
- When sun on roof- and treetops
- Encourages them to trickle,
- Then fall, but in mid-air *stop*---
- Sustain joy hugging tight as icicles.
