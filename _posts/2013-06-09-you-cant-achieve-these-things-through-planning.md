On Hitchwiki, the internet’s extremely useful repository of hitchhiking
wisdom to orient non-locals on their trips, the opening sentence for the
article on Vermont is: “Vermont is a hitchhiking mecca.” So when my
first ride out of Montréal left me at a junction with the highway to Vermont, I
decided on the spur of the moment to abandon my plan of hitching all the way to
the crossing into Maine several hours away, and took a ride straight down to
the Vermont border and walked across carefree, with just some looks askance
from the border patrol that I would dare to come without a car. And it was
true. The whole time in the state, I didn’t have to wait more than about
ten minutes for a ride. Most people were just going a little ways down the
road, but that was okay because I still made great time. The only exception to
the ten-minutes thing was when I got dropped off on a fast-moving stretch of
US-2, standing near a lake. There I waited maybe as much as twenty minutes
before Kyle picked me up.

He was headed all the way to Maine, so with him I was in three different states
-- Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine. What’s more, he was going several
hours into Maine, so he gave me a terrific amount of progress. But none of that
is the best part.

The best part is that he knows a girl who gives him lots of flak for picking up
hitchhikers all the time. This girl’s family was throwing a barbecue that
very night, and he considered the fact that it would be hilarious to walk into
the barbecue with a hitchhiker in tow. And that’s how I got invited to a
family barbecue in the middle of nowhere in Maine. Kyle drove us down an
encyclopedically memorized series of zigzagging backroads that would have
thrown off any CIA agent, and we pulled up to the girl’s family’s
house, and walked on in. He introduced me as a random hitchhiker, and everyone
took it completely in stride and thought it was pretty funny and asked me about
my trip and found it impressive. Then those of us who were of the younger
generation went to the room above the garage and watched a movie (The 2012
version of *21 Jump Street*). All the while I ate my fill, and I got to listen
in as *21 Jump Street* made everyone so nostalgic about high school that
they had to pull out their yearbooks and reminisce.

All of which goes to say that when hitchhiking is good, it’s kind of
unbeatable. Kyle would’ve even let me stay at his place for the night,
but he had a date, so instead he took me to a travel plaza where I was able to
set up my tent in the sadly rainy night. In the morning I was able to quickly
get to Bar Harbor, where I am now. But that story is still in progress.
