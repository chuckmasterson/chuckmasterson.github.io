Sorry about not blogging. I’ve been so busy with doing nothing. It takes
up all my time. Well, to be fair to me, I’ve been doing a lot of reading,
and in the last few days also a lot of getting my old fonts revised. I learned
a whole lot about making fonts the right way while I was working on Walleye,
and I realized that the fonts I’d made before probably had big problems.
I wanted to work those out so I could feel good about selling these, especially
because I’m planning on moving into a bigger pool. So far I’ve been
selling with Veer, which is a nice company and sells some pretty great fonts,
but is fairly small-time, at least compared with the giant of the field,
MyFonts, the biggest font website in the world. The nice thing is I don’t
have to tell Veer to take a hike, because I can sell through both websites at
once. I figured if I’m going to sell my fonts to potentially the entire
world, especially since Walleye is so international, I’d better make them
airtight. But you didn’t come here to read about my fonts, especially not
since that all started out as an excuse for why I haven’t written some of
these stories that I went traveling to gather. So I’m going to cut out
any further ado.

It took a while to get from Granada to Barcelona. When you hitchhike in Spain,
you find out quickly—or maybe that should be painfully slowly—that practically
everyone in the country is going “aquí al lado”: just around the
corner. This was the case when I got to the gas station at the edge of Granada,
although it didn’t help that I got started at three in the afternoon,
having taken the morning really slowly without making any sudden movements that
might disturb the thriving colonies of bacteria that had been residing in me
since I left a hippie commune with questionable sanitation several days prior.
One couple at the gas station told me they were in fact going the right way,
but they weren’t inclined to take me, which made them the only people on
my entire trip who came right out and said that they didn’t want to carry
a hitchhiker just because he was a hitchhiker, rather than because their
trucking company didn’t let them or because their car was already full to
the brim or whatever. The other hundred people who stopped at that station were
all going *aquí al lado.* But I did meet some other luckless hitchhikers, a
German couple named Elmi and Emmy, with chaotic dreads and exuberantly colored
clothes. As a courtesy they hitched a little further on from me, but they were
really just going through the motions; we all knew it was too late and the spot
was too lousy for us to have any luck tonight. They gave up first and soon
after I followed them to the bus station.

We slept there and in the morning we got on the second of the only two
long-distance buses I took all trip, to Murcia. We walked across town to find a
usable spot, and split up, and they got picked up first, but I eventually got a
ride. It always feels amazing to get in that first car after several days of
not hitching. Hitchhiking very quickly starts to feel to me like it never
really happened, like it’s all something I heard about once in a legend
when I was a kid. Then I get in the car and it all comes true once again. The
guy who took me was a Ecuadorian immigrant, and he left me at an onramp to the
highway, where a couple of sock salesmen picked me up and took me to a truck
stop down the road.

Truck stops are terrific places for hitchhiking—all the truckers are going
long-distance and a lot of them have a spare seat and lots of empty time
they’re looking to fill. Unfortunately, as I learned, truckers in Spain
don’t work on Sunday, and it was Sunday. I found the right trucker right
away, an old German guy with a beard who was going all the way to Barcelona as
soon as his boss called him the next morning. That left me unenthusiastic about
finding a different ride, so, still enervated from the hippie water, I tried
only halfheartedly, and the day gradually drained away. Around dark I gave up.
I hung out in the restaurant and chatted with the Uruguayan guy who worked
behind the bar. He liked my stories and gave me some free cake, which I
unfortunately couldn’t keep down. He also told me about a place I could
sleep to keep dry (this was after I lost my tent poles): in the parking lot
there was an abandoned black Volvo. It was cramped and unspeakably filthy, but
it kept off the rain and I didn’t have to touch it very much because I
was inside my sleeping bag. I missed my tent poles.

The German trucker’s boss waited and waited. The trucker couldn’t
speak any Spanish or English, so all I knew was that he’d be
*vielleicht* leaving soon. I really wish I’d known that that
doesn’t mean “probably”, it means “maybe”. I sat
there waiting for his boss to call all day, sometimes inside, sometimes walking
around in the drizzle. I told the guys at the counter (some of whom had been
working there yesterday) that I was pretty sure I lived at the truck stop now.
No other truckers were going to Barcelona: I checked. In fact, this truck stop
was evidently located in an outpost of the Bermuda Triangle, because no one in
it was going *anywhere*. Occasionally a truck would leave and head to an
industrial park that I could see nearby. The only ones that made it all the way
to the highway were the ones whose drivers were forbidden to pick anyone up or
the ones that were headed in the exact wrong direction. By now I was prepared
to take a ride in almost any direction. It was getting later. When dark came
again, I started going *crazy*, stomping on the ground and running in restless
circles and swearing. I just wanted to be *out* of this truck stop.

The only thing that took my mind briefly off of my endless frustrated boredom
was a guy who came by in a pickup covered in colorful decals. He started
creeping around stealthily while holding a big white pigeon tied to a string.
Now and then he would let it go and it would perch somewhere, and then he would
grab it again. “This I’ve got to hear,” I told him, but he
shushed me and looked up in the sky. And there, high up on a building next
door, was perched a rainbow-feathered pigeon. Soon it took the bait and came
down to see the other, stringed pigeon. The guy climbed up to the wall where it
had landed, quietly, without moving the white pigeon, and then, all at once,
gingerly pounced and grabbed the rainbow pigeon.  He raised it up to the sky
and then kissed it. “Two days I’ve been looking for this
pigeon!” he said to the few people who had now gathered to watch.
“It’s worth three thousand euros!” He showed me the satellite
tracking device it had on its leg, which had directed him here to this truck
stop belonging to the realm of nowhere. Of course, he was going *aquí al lado*.

After nightfall, I finally met someone who was promising. He was going *aquí al
lado*, but he really took a shine to me because I was American, and bought me
some drinks, and him some drinks (Jack Daniel’s for him, because he was
feeling American). And thus I met Spain’s version of a neocon. He told
me, and the whole bar, slurringly about all his opinions: Spain is going down
the toilet. Politicians are shameless thieves. It’s terrific that
Americans have the right to bear arms (here he was different from almost every
other European I met, who thought legal guns were the most absurd thing about
America). The death penalty is another great thing about America because
wouldn’t you want the death penalty for someone who raped your daughter?
He also told me I was definitely going to run into trouble hitchhiking, and if
I didn’t let him buy me a ticket to Barcelona with the 50-euro note he
was waving around, I would gravely offend him (to be precise, what he said was
“Me tocas los huevos,” a brand new phrase for me, literally
“You’re touching my balls”).

I don’t like to accept charity, as one of my principles, especially from
people who probably aren’t that well-off. I don’t want to steal the
mites from the widow when I have some of my own. But I was desperate and I
relented, and directly we took off zigzagging down the road to a little tin-box
train station. There he stood in the harsh fluorescent light and seemed to
sober up and wonder why he’d offered to give me 50 euros. He rescinded
that offer and bought me the furthest ticket we could get at the automatic
machine: only to Alicante, hundreds of kilometers short of my goal, costing him
just four euros. I decided not to argue, because that would only get me back to
the truck stop, and I’d probably spend another day going nowhere but
insane. Also, he seemed a bit edgy and I decided it was probably for the best
that I wasn’t going to be in the same car or bar with him again.

Alicante’s train services to Barcelona had quit for the night by the time
I got there on that lonely train, so I didn’t even have the option of
giving up that way.  Instead I took a subway and a tram as far north as I
could, which wasn’t very far because those quit for the night too. I
would transfer in the morning.  Meanwhile, I climbed on top of the little metal
shelter at the tram station, rolled out my bedroll, and slept.

In the morning I rolled up my stuff in the gathering dawn, then lowered it down
on a rope so it wouldn’t crash when it hit the ground and reveal me to
the people waiting for the tram. This caused me to feel like James Bond. I got
on and rode north.  The tram ride should have been pretty unremarkable, but it
turned out that it went right along the shore of the Mediterranean, and this
was the first time I’d actually seen the Mediterranean. I couldn’t
stop staring. The morning was dull and there was a hard wind kicking in off the
sea. I started recalling bits of the *Odyssey*. It really does have a way of
playing on the imagination.

I got off in the middle of nowhere where the tram was near the highway, and
while I waited for someone to have sympathy on me, the wind tried to knock me
over. Eventually I got a ride, and then another, slowly making my way up the
coast, and even learning—one ride was from a history professor, who explained
the ancient crumbling cylindrical hilltop fortifications I was seeing. The day
passed way too quickly and after dusk I found myself forlorn in a gas station
with ten minutes between customers. I asked people, with the hopelessness
evident in my voice, if they might possibly be going in the general direction
of Barcelona.

On only the second try, a young guy told me, “Yeah, climb in.” He
didn’t even seem excited about it, as if he picked up a hitcher at least
once a day.  But he was going all the way for real, and he took me there, and
he did have a personality, despite the first impression. He *hauled
ass* the whole way past everything else on the road, and then planted me
right in front of the Sagrada Família, only rear-ending one car on the way.

Barcelona: here it was. It was actually possible to arrive in Barcelona,
despite all of Spain’s best efforts to keep me thumbing for a few more
weeks. I goggled at the Sagrada Família from all its angles, while eating a
flawless fruit platter that I found in the garbage. I came to the conclusion
that the Sagrada Família is pretty much the ultimate building. Every square
inch is covered in detail and artistic intention, and bathed in symbolism. I
stared a long time. But then I had to go find where I was going to sleep.

Back in Granada, a fellow vagabond named Pipo—there are a lot of vagabonds in
Granada—had told me about a squat in Barcelona, an abandoned ice cream factory
that had been reclaimed by the people. I got to the right subway stop and then,
with the help of some anarchists who were passing out flyers about
tomorrow’s general strike, found the right way to walk. I ended up in a
neighborhood of giant, industrial buildings, and no people. But a lady at a gas
station gave me a map of this place—I was by now out of Barcelona—and I found
my way. I gave her a yogurt I’d just dumpstered. While I was at the
hippie commune, I met a guy who was walking down the road. I was just walking
into town for some errands, but he was walking to wherever the road took him
next. He’d just stayed at a nearby meditation center, but that was only
one place on his long walk, and he didn’t know when he might stop. He had
done the Way of St James, but when he got to the end he found it to be
unoriginal, full of people who didn’t know what they were doing,
hadn’t found any direction. So he set up his own pilgrimage, one that
started at the house that he was now giving up, and ended nowhere in
particular, whenever he decided he’d learned enough about himself that he
could stop. He gave me some chocolate—almost all he had. When I told him he
should keep more for himself, he told me he always gave away what he had.
“If you have things, you’re always afraid of losing them,” he
told me. “But if you have nothing and you give everything freely, you
have nothing to fear.” I thought about him while I gave that yogurt cup
to the gas station lady. I was happy to part with it.

When I got to CamyKaZ squat, there was no mistaking that I’d arrived at
the right place: it was covered with paintings and the gate was festooned with
pink ribbons. Unfortunately, it also bore a sign that told me it was closed for
the day. I didn’t really understand how a squat could have opening hours.
As far as I knew, squats are just places where people sleep and dwell for free.
But no one answered the doorbell, so I sat and wrote my journal while I waited
for someone to appear.

Eventually someone did come outside the building, and I went over and got him
to let me in. I expected a warehouse in pretty much the state it was in when
the Camy ice cream company abandoned it. I found a vast, lavish area full of
accommodations and adapted as perfectly as possible for being a great place to
hang around and live. It was big enough that you could test out a homemade hang
glider in there, and the paintings on the walls didn’t leave me much
doubt that the inhabitants were creative enough to do that sort of thing if
they wanted to. The wall off to the left was covered by a vivid painting of an
alien landing in a flying saucer, wearing a makeshift beak to try to fool a
very suspicious chicken army general who managed to be fluffily adorable while
wearing belts of ammo.

To the right was a kitchen, stocked full of dumpstered bread and other good 
stuff (when I came in, dozens of cups of yogurt). In the next room there was a
trapeze and mats, and a woman painting a wall to prepare the place for a
medieval show that they would be putting on a couple days after I left.
Upstairs was an Englishman named Daz, making monks’ robes for the same
show. The old manager’s office on the second floor (or rather, suspended
on its own under the roof and above the floor of the trapeze room) had been
converted into a wayfarers’ room, with a few mattresses on the floor and
a notice saying anyone could pass through for four days. No worries—I
wouldn’t even have time to exhaust that number of days.

It was after one in the morning when I got there, but there was still fun stuff
to do. I met a Frenchman whose name I forget, and we decided to go out on the
nightly three-a.m. bakery run together. He got onto a bike that Daz
custom-welded at CamyKaZ, low to the ground with a giant basket on the front
that was big enough for a couple people to sit in. The French guy filled it
with a crate to which we added old bread that not even the whole population of
CamyKaZ could take care of before it started piling up too high with bread from
the next day and the day after. CamyKaZ never wants for bread. We went out to
the Emigrant Bakery, and pretty soon a guy rolled around in a truck. He pulled
out crates full of the stuff from the previous day and let us take care of
them; we pulled out what we wanted and made sure not to waste the truck
driver’s time while he left behind new stuff. Then he rolled off and we
checked out all our booty. Incredible stuff! Among other things, I had a flaky
rectangular pastry the size of a slipper filled with fruit jam. It was one of
the more delicious things I’ve gotten from a bakery in my memory.

The next day was November 14th, the day of the 14N Vaga General (Catalan for
“general strike”). The problem I was faced with: How to get there?
Because the subway and tram workers were on strike too. And the center of
Barcelona, where the *manifestación* would be, was two hours away on foot.
I wandered around indecisive. Along the way I found poster for the local
*manifestación* and march of this particular neighborhood (which goes by
the entertaining name of Esplugues de Llobregat). I was already late, but with
no better options, I decided to go where it had been and see if I could figure
out where I should go from there on foot.

As it happened, when I got there, the local crowd of banner-carrying, shouting
anticapitalists was still there and assembled, and was just getting ready to
march all the way to the main *manifestación* downtown.

I’ve traveled by many different means in my life: car, Cambodian
low-sided boat, semi truck, bicycle, canoe, airplane. But I couldn’t say
that I’d ever traveled by anarchist bloc.  


{% include fig.html src="Adventure 493.jpg" %}

There were more people than I expected, especially from some industrial suburb 
of the city. Spain seems to take its counterculture seriously. I joined in, and
even managed to find the guy who’d given me directions the night before,
named Domingo, I think. He shielded his face from the photographers as he
walked, and explained things to me about Spanish politics. Thanks to the crazy
guy at the truck stop and a few other people who’d given my rides, I
already had a fairly good idea of how corrupt the Spanish government is. I also
knew, from beforehand, that Spain is one of the only places where anarchy has
actually been put in place on a large scale in a way that would actually have
worked if the Francoists hadn’t beaten them asunder. Domingo explained
that the police here also had a history of being pretty brutal if things went
in some way they didn’t approve of. This stayed on my mind as I looked at
the brigade of police cars behind us and the other brigade a hundred yards
ahead of us and the odd cops on foot on either side of us. But I guess they had
resigned to letting the bloc do its thing unimpaired, because they kept that
distance and didn’t beat anyone, at least that I saw. We chanted as we
walked: *Tenemos solución: ¡Bankeros a prisión!* (We have the solution: Bankers
to prison!) *¡No es crisis, es capitalismo!* (It’s not a crisis,
it’s capitalism!) *¡An, anti, anticapitalistas!* People along the
road would shout out encouragement to us, or join in the march, or chant along
with us.  


{% include fig.html src="Adventure 494.jpg" %}

As we went, from directions I never identified, our numbers got bigger and 
bigger. We’d started out with a few dozen people, but before I even
noticed, the crowd had swollen to at least a few hundred, taking up four
traffic lanes and stretching so far that from the middle I couldn’t see
any evidence of a front or a back to the swarm.  Also, we decided we were
going to take the direct route to the city. That meant the highway. I
didn’t realize we were on it until we’d already spilled off the
onramp onto the main road and suddenly there were big signs overhead and lane
after lane to spread out into. We took over all the inbound lanes, then a
couple of the outbound lanes, and finally the whole width of the highway. I
think everyone there must have been feeling the same thing I was feeling: a
sense of enormous power, the power to conquer a highway. If anything represents
capitalism, besides a Walmart, isn’t it a highway? But this feeling was
tempered by the knowledge that we only had this power because the system
allowed us to. We were many, but the cops had us outgunned all the same, and if
they had decided that we actually posed a threat, they could’ve arrested
us all, or even mowed us all down with machine guns, in minutes. The fact that
they weren’t bothering meant that this protest, like most protests, was
little more than symbolic. The little guys hold a general strike; the big pigs
take it in stride, maybe give nominal pay raises; nothing really changes. The
Spanish system has encompassed protest as a part of business as usual.
I’d say it’s about in the middle of the spectrum where it comes to
dealing with malcontents. In less powerful countries, the dictator has to
suppress outbreaks with brutal force, because it’s actually possible that
they could achieve their goals and topple him. In the most powerful countries,
like the US, the government doesn’t even need to deal with protesters,
because it’s learned how to use the media and money cleverly enough that
all the people control themselves from inside their own heads, or control each
other through the pressure to be normal like every other good American.

Through the streets of downtown Barcelona, we arrived at a big column at a main
intersection.  


{% include fig.html src="Adventure 495.jpg" %}

Some other districts’ blocs had joined us on the way, and now we had 
arrived at the center where all the other blocs were. The crowd stretched
backward thousands strong down all four streets that converged at the
Pillar. In the center there were news vans and people climbing up the monument
and a vanguard with megaphones. I waited to hear what they were going to say.

I was waiting a long time. I read people’s signs.  I tried to listen in,
but they were mostly speaking Catalan, which is as different from Spanish as
French is, or they were speaking Castilian (standard Spanish) faster than I
could make out. I really need to practice my Spanish for a long time.
Understanding everything would’ve made everything much more interesting
at the column. I read flyers, and listened to scattered announcements from the
megaphone about waiting for one last bloc. Time passed.  Maybe the crowd in
general kept its energy, but I felt myself becoming less and less engaged.

Things perked back up when the last bloc got there. But I was expecting some
speeches. I guess maybe that’s not so much in line with the philosophies
of this sort of group, because they want to be laterally organized, not
organized top-down with some head honcho giving orders. That would be very
un-anarchical. Very archical? But still, there are people who can offer
interesting perspectives on the problems of a country in that sort of
situation. Some people have studied history and politics and know where the
country has been and where it’s headed and what could be done to change
that. They didn’t have anyone like that; they just had someone who was
driving the truck at the vanguard, and told everyone that, okay, now that the
full numbers were amassed, it was now time to continue the march.

And it was an impressive march: I won’t take that away from it. Thousands
of excited, screaming people clamoring for a change, of some sort, something
getting all that wealth out of the hands of the undeserving rich. Maybe it even
achieved something: maybe some people who watched all this energy manifesting
itself looked on and thought, “These people have got something going. I
want in.” But then again, maybe those people just got annoyed that the
subways weren’t running and the highways were jammed.  I’m not sure
what the impact was, because I’m not Spanish and I didn’t
understand much of what was going on. But for me, it felt like the march was a
symbol for the movement: going and going, but never arriving anywhere. We
walked through the broadest streets for a long time, slowly, but probably
covering miles. I wanted to see where this would all end. But I also had to
consider that I needed to get back to CamyKaZ, and the subways did have a few
hours when they would actually be open, and that window was quickly closing. So
I ducked into a station and rode the most crowded trains I’ve ever
ridden, with people all but moshing to fit everyone in, back to Esplugues de
Llobregat.

Back at CamyKaZ, you wouldn’t know anything was going on. Daz was sewing
away, and someone was cooking a communal dinner for the whole squat, and in the
other room they were finishing the wall.  I helped them get some of the highest
spots, since I was the only one fearless enough of high ladders. I ate with
them, and I played chess with the French guy from the night before, and I
watched a guy with a white-man afro practice tattooing on a pig’s ear
that he’d gotten from a butcher somewhere.  I loved this place. In the
morning I even discovered that they had an indoor duck pond. Someone was
introducing a chicken to it.


{% include fig.html src="Adventure 497.jpg" %}

That day I felt like something a little calmer. There was an appointment I 
needed to keep: I still hadn’t given the Mediterranean Sea its due.
I’d watched it roll past the tram window, and at that wide-open windy
first hitching spot I’d been able to see it and know that was where the
gusts were being drawn to that were sending me stumbling forward, but I
hadn’t yet sat down next to it and looked at it.

In a sudden inspiration the previous night, I’d realized that the perfect
way to do it would be to sit down on the beach and draw the waves crashing
toward me. I bought a single piece of paper from an internet cafe, and also a
beer from a little family shop, and after a long walk through the tall
buildings of downtown, I came to the seaside. It wasn’t cold, but it
wasn’t the sort of weather that brought families out in their swimsuits
to come enjoy a day splashing around. People were walking around in the sand
and a few intrepid swimmers were in the water. Well back above the high-tide
line there were restaurants where people wearing snappy clothes ate very
expensive food. I found some rather tasty free food in a different place, then
walked down across the beach to claim a spot as my own vantage point. I sat
down in the sand. Off to my right in the distance was a concrete jetty where
people were walking out to see the sea better. Ahead there was one
indeterminate nautical object sticking out of the water on a metal pole, and
now and then a sailboat, but otherwise clear unbroken water all the way to the
horizon. To the left was the pier I’d come in from, but I decided to
leave it out of my frame. I took out the paper. With the back of a little
paperback copy of *Where I Was* by James Kelman as my drawing table, I
started sketching. The sea did most of the work. I just had to sit there and be
the filter. I don’t draw much, but it came pretty easy there. A guy came
by and tried to sell me a beer, but I showed him the one that I already had. I
very slowly drained that, and I filled up my half-sheet of paper. Time passed.
The beer guy came back from the other direction and I held mine up again, and
he laughed and went on.  Some time later he came back for a third pass.
Unfortunately for him, though my beer was empty, I was just about done. I eyed
the drawing, and then the sea. It was a decent likeness. I carefully stashed it
inside my book and stood up. I considered, and decided that it did feel like
I’d finally seen the sea, and I could go to a different place now with a
clean conscience. It’s important to give a sea the time it deserves.

Before I went back to spend my last night at CamyKaZ, I had one more thing to
take care of. I needed to see the Sagrada Família by day. And I was glad I went
back. I could see all the details I had missed when I came at night. Never have
I seen a building that looks so much like it wasn’t built, it grew.
It’s as if Catalonia is just the right biome for Antoni Gaudí buildings,
and here in the center of Barcelona there were the perfect conditions for the
largest, most long-lived, most ornate specimen to sprout and blossom into
sixteen towers and hundreds of elaborate carvings and endless reticules of
scaffolding that the organism protects itself in until maturity.

I made it back to CamyKaZ in time for cinema night. Behind the painting of the
chicken alien, they have a full cinema set up, and tonight they showed *Quest
for Flame*, a weird prehistorical movie about grunting Neanderthals trying to
find a flame to carry back to their homeland (they had inexplicably decided to
live in the middle of a rainy bog). They come across a tribe of *Homo sapiens*,
who are comparatively the new kid in town, and learn from them that it’s
possible to *make* fire instead of carrying it forever; they also somehow charm
a human woman (who spends the whole film naked) back to their bog, with time on
the journey back for drama and animalesque sex. I also talked with Daz and some
of the other people there, but I had an early morning, so I went to bed far too
early to make the nightly bakery run.

I woke up and scooped up a bit of the night’s haul, then found trains to
Montcada i Reixac and the highway northward, where I stuck my thumb out toward
France. If I’d seen all that in three days, who knows what I
could’ve done if I’d stayed longer, but I had other places to take
by storm.
