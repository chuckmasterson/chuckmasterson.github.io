Micah and I went frogging last night and took some pictures. Here they come.

{% include fig.html src="IMAG0004.jpg" caption="Underside. He looks like he’s
terrified, but somewhere deep down, having fun a little bit." %} 


{% include fig.html src="IMAG0005.jpg" caption="“Whatever. Just put me back
when you’re finished, okay?” The hand is Micah’s." %} 


{% include fig.html src="IMAG0006.jpg" caption="Burke’s pond has some very deep
and rich mud. Smells sulfurous. For all this, I still didn’t catch the frog I
was going after." %} 


Frogging is fun. We plan to go many more times this summer.
