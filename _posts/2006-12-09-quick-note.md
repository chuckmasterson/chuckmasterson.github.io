Just a quick post to tell you that I won’t really be writing a post this
weekend (chew on that paradox). Instead I’m finishing definitively my college
stuff. I just did an essay about why Carleton and I go together well. It had a
2000-character limit. My essay, through no planning of my own, ended up at
exactly 2000 characters. (Unfortunately, to achieve that, I ended up getting
rid of the postscript at the end that said, “P.S. I also can’t get enough of
that Minnesota accent.”) Look for me next weekend. As the Beatles said, “I’ll
be ’round.” Those crazy circular Brits.

P.S. I hate my life: I just found out that the 2000-character limit was for
Kenyon, and Carleton’s was 400.
