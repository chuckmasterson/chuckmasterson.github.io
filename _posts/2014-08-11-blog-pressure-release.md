So here’s what I’m going to do today. I realized that there are
about three separate blogsful of stuff I need to write about, but in order to
keep this all under one update and not confuse anyone unnecessarily, I’m
going to put all three of them here.

* * *

#### 1\. Change Up

Remember that dead-end job I said I hated? Done with that. But let us take a
moment and unpack what there is to take away from that experience.

The job I was doing is a job that’s necessary when ordinary people, with
ordinary brains, have to interact with unnecessarily, grotesquely complicated
systems created not by humans but by committees, which are infinitely worse.
Committees and their systems don’t have any common sense. You don’t
realize how important common sense is until you come into touch with a complete
absence of it. It’s how we navigate day-to-day life; it’s the
accretion of thousands, even millions of years of knowledge of how the world
works and how a human can stay alive in it. Its antithesis: American healthcare
laws. Here’s a system that people would be able to understand:
“I’m sick, and I need a medicine to be better. My doctor says which
medicine it is and how much. I go get it from the pharmacy.” Similarly:
“I’m hurt, and I need a doctor to get better. I go to the hospital,
where the doctors are. They fix me up.” 

Instead, what people get is something more along the lines of: “I’m
sick, and I need a medicine to be better. My doctor says which medicine it is
and how much, but I can’t afford it on my own because everyone buys
medicine through a middleman and so the manufacturers can raise the prices to
absurd heights and no one questions it, unless through one of many possible
cracks in the system they have to pay for it on their own, in which case
they’ll probably go broke pretty quickly. I go to the pharmacy to get it
but they have to ask the insurance company for permission through the claims
adjudicator (that’s Express Scripts!), and it has to be the right
insurance company because now some companies won’t give me certain
medicines like contraceptives, and maybe there’s a problem or maybe I get
my medicine, and if I don’t get my medicine I have to call up a phone
number and talk to a computer, and if the computer doesn’t know the
answer then I have to wait to talk to a person, and maybe that person has to
talk to a different person, and maybe I’m supposed to get my medicine
through the mail, which takes days but I’m sick now.” I won’t
even get into the hospital side of it, not least because I don’t
understand it myself. 

But it’s no wonder that under this oppressive opacity, people get
fatalistic. An old woman whose medicine was delayed in the mail for no apparent
reason told me that she’d already been given more than the full three
score and ten years allotted her by God, and maybe it would be simpler for her
to just die. Another woman was having trouble getting the specific medicine she
wanted and asked us where we got off telling her what she could and
couldn’t take and why we were allowed to play God. You get to see a
theme. Because the system has no face and no common sense, arguing with it is
almost like arguing with force majeure, asking a hurricane to calm down, asking
God to stay his wrath. The only difference is that when the system ignores you,
it can ignore you personally and in a human language.

There’s another system I worked with that’s more benign and where
problems mostly end up in laughs: chemical names. One of the big lessons I
learned is that no one but no one can pronounce generic drug names. It was
agonizing, yet funny, listening to people try to talk about their
hydrochlorothiazide or cyclobenzaprine or atorvastatin. Some of them people can
at least make a stab at, like methotrexate or gabapentin, but on those ones and
a bunch of others, people just sort of say the first syllable and mumble, or
give up preemptively and spell it out. Other good ones: simvastatin
(“sim-*vast*-in?”), methylprednisolone, metoprolol, propranolol,
bupropion, ipratropium, omeprazole, amlodipine
(“amma-la-*die*-peen?”), eszopiclone, levetiracetam,
lisdexamfetamine (looks like they just came right out and made fun of dyslexics
on that one, and to add insult to injury it’s for ADD). 

When you belong to a system as enormous and inhuman as the one I worked
for—Express Scripts is the largest prescription benefits management company in
the USA—you must become inhuman too. Our hours were regimented as though we
were computers. You must begin taking calls within the first 4 to 5 minutes of
your shift, and from then on, you may only stop taking calls during two (2)
15-minute breaks and one (1) unpaid 30-minute lunch period, all of which are
algorithmically scheduled at certain minutes of your day. You may spend up to
2% of your day, but much preferably 0%, on unscheduled restroom breaks. If you
have a problem that prohibits you from taking calls you must put your telephone
into one of nine auxiliary modes, two of which are deprecated, and you must
make a note of the minute you went into auxiliary and came out of it, which you
must then e-mail to your supervisor. As to the content of calls, you must
carefully memorize which information you are permitted to divulge (or
“speak to”) with which parties; for example, you may need to
nonsensically tell a parent that they may not be told the name of a drug their
child takes that is paid under the parent’s insurance plan because the
child is over eighteen (18) years of age, but if the parent mentions the name
him/herself, you may tell him/her all other details about it. You must begin
each call with a Greeting and a Willingness Statement (such as “I’d
be more than happy to help you with that). You must address the caller by name
at least once per call. You must offer to enroll the caller in the Worry-Free
Fills program and to create an EZWeb profile for the caller. And so on. 

They don’t even speak a human language there. They speak in acronyms,
presumably because they sound more official and correct than mere words. A
supervisor isn’t known as a supervisor, but as an RTL (resolution team
lead). A day off is referred to only as PTO (paid time off).  Bonus pay became
OPI, and I don’t think anyone really knows what that stands for. Likewise
with LMS, the name of the training program we accessed in order to watch poorly
voiceovered slideshows to learn the specifics of how to service certain groups
of customers. My favorite, though must have been the word for
“problem” (or possibly “rule violation”), which was a
QSO, for “quality service opportunity”. 

Enough about that. I knew from the first day that I needed to get out of there,
and this week I did it. I’ve been applying to jobs with sign companies
and print shops and stuff. (To wrap up a loose end, that interview I mentioned
in my last post didn’t end up with me getting the job, but I was okay
with that, because when I went in, I discovered it wasn’t really what I
thought. It gave off intense auras of “better than everyone” and
“hipster”, and I discovered that I would get one week of vacation
per year, with the first week not available until the end of the first full
year. That kind of yearly schedule should be criminal, and I think in most OECD
countries it is.) What I ended up getting is fairly unrelated. I found the job
through my housemate Will, who’s a great guy and teaches middle school
and has head and face hair much like mine but lighter. He introduced me to
Rick, who’s in charge of a company that makes electric components for
diesel engines. His company has recently invented something that keeps diesel
engines from freezing up in cold weather, and it’s apparently the first
of its kind and everyone wants one. I’ll be doing a bunch of different
things, many of which I don’t know yet: web design, catalog management,
internet ads. He knows how all this stuff works and will teach me, he just
doesn’t have time to do it all himself because the company’s
growing so fast. So I get to learn a bunch of useful skills, while working
full-time, and to boot I get four weeks of vacation a year and nine holidays.
I’ll be working for a much smaller, more personal company, where I can
talk to the president (Rick) whenever and on a first name basis, whereas before
I was at least five organizational levels away from the president. It’s a
company that has common sense, and that counts for a lot, as I’ve been
trying to describe today. I start Wednesday.

#### 2\. Paleo by Attrition

Now here’s something else that I need to mention. After years of thinking
about the paleo diet, talking about why it makes sense, and telling everyone
that they should do it to solve their health problems, I’m finally
starting to actually *do* the paleo diet. That way, when I talk about it,
I won’t feel like a charlatan, and I’ll be able to speak from
actual experience.

I’ve had a few brief periods of paleo before, none of them strict and
none of them long enough to be worth anything scientifically or
therapeutically. There are two main things that have kept me from committing in
the past. First, you may have noticed that I’ve been traveling a lot.
Paleo is very much an anti-restaurant, cook-your-own-authentic-food diet, and
it’s hard to follow it when you’re getting your nutrition from
truck stop dumpsters or strangers handing you Big Macs. 

Second is the bigger one, I think: I’m just in excellent health. All my
life I’ve been able to eat anything I want and stay the same weight and
hardly feel any ill effects. I’ve eaten nearly whole cakes, I’ve
eaten meals that could have fed four people, and yet I have no gut. I have no
big health problem to solve through diet, so why change anything? But I know
the answer to that, and I’ve been denying it: it’s possible to look
healthy and feel healthy and then discover later on in life that all that crap
has caught up to you in the form of some debilitating disease or just a
shortened lifespan. It’s also possible that I could feel better in ways I
don’t even realize. Maybe my skin will look better, maybe I’ll have
more consistent energy through the day, maybe my hair will grow longer. Maybe
my mustache will finally get its act together and grow into something that
doesn’t look like it belongs to a thirteen-year-old.

So I’m going to embark on this, experimentally, and see what data I can
turn up. And here’s how I’m doing it: I’m getting rid of one
proscribed food at a time, until they’re all gone. Partially this is
because I have some stuff I want to use up and some scheduled days when
I’ll be eating certain things. (Milk in the fridge, and I’m making
potato-containing *placki po węgiersku* with Will for a house
dinner in mid August.) Partially it’s so I can have a sort of last hurrah
with each crap ingredient I eat. Those of you who saw me gorging on cupcakes
and cake at the family reunion were witnessing my final indulgence in wheat
(and gluten). I had a tamale and a big bucket of popcorn the other day and now
I’m done with corn. For sugar I’ll probably go for ice cream. And
so on.

A lot of these things I’ll be adding back in in modest amounts, but
I’m going to go without all of it for at least a month so I can get a
good read on what happens when I reintroduce each thing. That’s
scientific! I’ve been reading several books and websites about nutrition,
and while they all seem to agree on the main points, when it comes to the
details I’ve mostly read that it’s up to me to figure out what
works best for my own constitution. I suspect that, with my iron stomach,
I’ll be perfectly able to handle dairy and rice with no observable
effect. But I’m still going to forgo them for a while just for the sake
of data. One must have data, data at any cost.

The nice part about all this experimenting I’m doing is that most of you
don’t have to worry about it at all, because I’m so far away from
you that you’re not cooking for me. I’ll just relay the results to
you, and by the next time I see you, I’ll have a good handle on how to
cook that way and a bunch of good recipes to use, and it’ll be easy to
navigate. So here’s to some improved eating. I’ll let you know when
I’m off all the things I’m ditching, and I’ll write here
about anything interesting that happens.

Meanwhile, a book I recommend is *The Perfect Health Diet*.  The book is really
well researched and gives a really good all-encompassing perspective on
nutrition and digestion and all that. The diet isn’t very restrictive but
it apparently works wonders with people. It’s paleo-like in that it rules
out wheat and vegetable oil and some other stuff, but it also allows such
contraband as potatoes and rice. I’m not going to say a lot more, though,
until I’ve done the experiment. That’s just for anyone who may be
interested or might be contemplating a diet themselves.

#### 3\. High on Brain

When I was on my way to Chicago, something hit me. I don’t know if it was
the change of pace from being in the city all the time, or if it was the rush
of speed, or maybe the focus of mind that comes when you have to drive and
block out anything unrelated. Whatever it was, though, I felt fantastic.
Thoughts appeared and clarified themselves. Everything I saw catalyzed a new,
deep idea. If I could sustain that state, I could write a novel a week. I
settled for remembering all the ideas for later, when I knew I would be in a
less amazing mental state.

One thing I realized was that, now that I’m done with Express Scripts, I
need to work on my own personal goals, my fulfillment of who I am. So I’m
going to set aside some time every night, or at least a few times a week if I
can’t swing that, to do something creative. I’ll practice
calligraphy, I’ll write a book, I’ll learn an instrument. Much
later, after this car ride, I discovered that there are a few enterprising
folks scattered around who have figured out that you can use a dentist drill
and a diamond burr to write calligraphy on glass, and for this people will pay
pretty well, especially if you’re good at it.

Also, just a couple days ago, I used some of the inspiration that I’d
sent forward from my past and rode around the city looking for a place to play
krokay. I think we could really use an outing where we all just do something
fun, without worrying about house logistics and how the garden is doing and
who’s cooking when and all that stuff that burdens us sometimes when we
meet in the house. Minneapolis has some big parks, but they’re mostly big
because of the lakes inside them, so I haven’t found a lost,
back-of-nowhere place like the classic course in Winton Woods in Cincinnati.
But I did find a pretty great little pocket of forest with a good grassy hill
next to it, and it even named itself for me when I went there: I was exploring
a hill a little further back into the forest, and as I walked by, something
hopped in the undergrowth. I peered in and there stood a full-grown wild
turkey, calmly pecking at the ground and leaves. It hopped on its left leg and
kept its right leg tucked up to its breast, clearly injured. I stood watching
it and trying to learn its life for as long as it stayed in view of me. Then I
went back to my bike slightly breathless and trying to decide what name fit the
place best: Left-Leg Turkey Hill? Lame Turkey Hill? Turkey Hop Hill? Your input
is welcome.

Anyhow, I mention this because I feel like this last week or two has been
something of a watershed. I’ve gotten to see a lot of family, I’ve
won some trophies for croquet, I’ve gotten a job that won’t make me
miserable, and I’ve decided I’m going to put some serious thought
into figuring out where my life is going to go from here and how I can keep on
improving it. Since I’m tired at the moment that I’m writing this,
I can’t make a lot of this planning very vivid for you because it’s
not vivid for me right now. But rest assured, it’ll be good. 

#### P.S.: Photos

Here’s a logistical question for the blog. I hear you all want to see my
pictures from Europe, and I keep forgetting I still haven’t put those up.
There are two ways I can do it: I can go back to all my old posts and add
photos to them, and then link back to them from a new post on the front page.
Or I can write brand new posts with brief captions for all the photos, but you
won’t have the whole story to tie it all together. Do you have a
preference?
