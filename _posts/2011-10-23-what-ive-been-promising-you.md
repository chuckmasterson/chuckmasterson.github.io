I keep saying: “I’ll post pictures soon.” By now I’ve
been stringing you along for a good while. Here are some pictures that go back
a ways. I have so many that I’m going to need to write two blog posts to
fit them all in it… even this one is a bit of a stretch.

Let’s start it off with some garbage I found on a mountain a few weeks
ago. This is the package from an army ration of bibimbap. I thought perhaps
Dad might get a kick out of seeing another country’s MREs. Bibimbap is
actually not that hospitable to being put in a bag—you’re supposed to
keep all the ingredients separate inside the bowl so that, until just before
you mix it up to eat it, the bowl from above looks like a pie chart (a pie
chart with a fried egg in the center). I guess they don’t bother with
all that separation in the rations.

Here are a few pictures of Myeongdong, the main shopping district for
fashionable tweens in Seoul. It is an amusing place.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 007.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 008.jpg" %}

(I think this one may actually be in Chuncheon, but it’s in
the same spirit.)

{% include fig.html src="Forced 031.jpg" %}

This is what the street vendor system looks like. These vendors are
everywhere, but in Myeongdong they aren’t too far away from some kind of
critical mass. In Itaewon, the foreigners’ neighborhood, they line the
sidewalks, and they all seem to be selling the same three things: socks, flat
caps, or T-shirts. Either Itaewon is the only place in Seoul where you can get
flat caps, or there must be a *huge* demand for flat caps among the
foreigner community in Seoul. Or it’s another example of how Korean
economics don’t really make sense.

Here are pictures from the time we went to Sokcho and Seoraksan—I
wrote about this a few posts ago. First here’s what the zipline was like.
We were this high up:

{% include fig.html src="Forced 016.jpg" %}

And we went over this:

{% include fig.html src="Forced 018.jpg" %}

Here’s Natalie.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 020.jpg" %}

There goes Natalie.  

{% include fig.html src="Forced 021.jpg" %}

While looking for a restaurant or a taxi, we accidentally came across this
impossible place.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 022.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 023.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 024.jpg" caption="(Sean and Natalie.)" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 025.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 026.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 027.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 028.jpg" %}

Later on, back in town, I took a walk around and looked at things.
I wasn’t surprised to learn that fishing is important to Yangyang.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 029.jpg" %}

I was less able to explain this large-balled bull.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 030.jpg" %}

The following morning we went to Seoraksan. Here are the other three
considering the enormity of this cable car.  

{% include fig.html src="Forced 034.jpg" %}

As I recounted before, Sean and I decided the cable car was for sissies, so we
took the cool way and climbed up to Ulsan Rock. (This is also a part of
Seoraksan. As far as we could gather, Seoraksan isn’t one single
mountain, but rather a sort of complex of peaks all answering to their own
names and also to Seoraksan.) On the way, we passed a giant Buddha that just
happened to be there.

To contrast with the serenity of the previous shot, here I
demonstrate my ability to look like a total yokel.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 036.jpg" %}

Our destination.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 039.jpg" %}

When we got closer, it started to dawn on us that this was a
serious rock.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 044.jpg" %}

I desperately wanted to do this.  

{% include fig.html src="Forced 045.jpg" %}

I believe I told you that this hike was crowded, but I don’t know if I
was able to convey to you the severity of the situation. This is what I meant.
*This*, as I said, is what happens when there are 50 million people in a
small country and you convince them all that one mountain is the very best.

But if you can ignore all the humanity for a moment, you can see
why the ordeal is worth it. Please click on this one to enlarge it.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 049.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 055.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 051.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 053.jpg" %}

{% include fig.html src="Forced 059.jpg" %}

Unfortunately, the Korean apathy toward nature stretched even to
here.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 060.jpg" %}

It puzzles me. They keep the insides of their buildings so clean. Amanda
and I have to sweep the classroom every day before the end of school.
It’s tiled with tiles that have a picture of carpet on them. We have to
sweep each and every tile, even if there’s clearly nothing on it. Last
Friday, my co-teacher channeled her perpetual agitation into sweeping: she
swept *between classes*—and she’s not an idiot, so she fully knew
that the kids would just mess it up again. She’s not an exception—most
Koreans I know of would say it’s extremely important to have a spotless
house. But outside, they toss garbage anywhere, even on their national
treasures. I guess the outside isn’t worth considering. Or maybe they
know that there’ll always be someone along shortly to tidy up. This is
true. Wherever there’s garbage, people—usually really old people towing
huge carts—come pick it up and lug it away in massive loads. I don’t know
where it goes, but I assume they’re getting paid for it somehow,
somewhere.  

Back at the base, Sean noted that his guidebook had a discrepancy from
reality. He’s pointing at it with his thumb, if you enlarge this.

Lastly, here are a few disorganized photos. I think this one is from Seoul
Station. Most of the English I see around here is pretty sensible, but every
once in a while you see evidence that a lot of Koreans just don’t get it.
The C here didn’t fall off, it was just never there. I know because there
was another sign identical to this one that also didn’t have the C.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 070.jpg" %}

And here’s Sachangni in the fall.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 071.jpg" %}

The statue of the Buddha that we have next to the temple
overlooking town.

{% include fig.html src="Forced 074.jpg" %}

I biked up here the other day to stretch my legs and see a view that
wasn’t the one from my window. I met a soldier there, and we each spoke a
little of the other’s language, so we had a little conversation. There
were two buildings, and he explained that one of them was the soldiers’
temple where they could do ceremonies, and the other was for civilians. He also
showed me the little clearing next to the statue, where you can sit and look up
at it. There are benches and chestnut trees. Chestnuts are in season right now,
and roasted chestnuts also happen to be one of my very favorite foods, so I
picked one up, but he told me they were no good for eating, because they have
worms and they’re small. Nonetheless, I found a clean, decent-sized one
and took it home.  

The next day I decided I believed him about the worms.
