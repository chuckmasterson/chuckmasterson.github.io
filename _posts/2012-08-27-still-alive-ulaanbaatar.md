I made it safely to Mongolia yesterday, minus my raincoat, which Air China
seems to have stolen. I’m not going to write about it now at full length
since this is just a check-in sort of thing. (I think whenever I do a quick
post like this I’ll call it “Still alive: [wherever I am]”.)
But from what I saw from the plane, I’m going to really like Mongolia.
That’s in the future tense because I’m still in the city, which
isn’t a terribly exciting city, but it certainly has its charms as well,
like the absolutely amazing band I saw yesterday (with a couple Grinnellians
and a Cincinnatian). But that’s a story for later. Today I’ve got
exploring to do.
