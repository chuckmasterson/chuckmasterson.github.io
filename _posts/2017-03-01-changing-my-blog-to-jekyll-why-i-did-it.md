*This is the first of two posts about redoing my blog, although the other one will be aimed at
a different audience, mostly consisting of programmers trying to do the same thing I did.*
{: .prefatory }

*I’m aware that I promised to write about sugarbush. My time there turned out not to be a solid week
but several discontinuous days, and I haven’t yet spent all the time I’m planning to spend there.
I’ll write when I have, but meanwhile I’ve been wanting to write this.*
{: .prefatory }

I'm going to take on a bit of a challenge: I’m going to try to make some very nerdy programming
stuff interesting to regular people, people who have no interest in code other than that it should
work---even people who fear code and want nothing to do with it. I’m going to try to explain why
I spent what probably totaled up to at least a full work week, and maybe two, reprogramming this
blog from the ground up. Bear with me; I really am going to attempt to put in some ideas that
you have a chance of caring about.

You may know that I’m planning to move off the grid soon. Misty and I have had this plan for years,
but only recently has the realization gradually snuck up on me that this is a very big change in my
life. Over the last couple months I’ve been working on moving mentally, so that when I move
physically I won’t leave myself behind. Strangely enough, spending several dozen hours elbow-deep in
code has been a part of that process. Let me explain.

The more you learn about computer programs, the more you should distrust them. And in my job as
a code monkey, I’ve spent the better part of the last three years learning a *lot* about computer
programs (often things that I had no job-related reason to learn about, just because they seemed
interesting). If you use computer programs like most people do, and have no particular curiosity
about what’s going on behind the scenes, our society’s collective technosystem probably looks fairly
stable to you. Beyond the occasional crash, most programs you use do what they’re told, and they do
it consistently, and the little colored icon squares you use to get to them show up reasonably close
to on time when you wake up your phone or your computer. 

Just getting to that point was hard won. It’s true, computers do work pretty well for the things
that a lot of people really want to do: edit documents, get directions, read email, watch ~~porn~~
videos. But consider what it took to achieve that: millions of man-hours; the creation of an entire
new industrial sector; concomitant factories in poor areas of distant countries; a purgatory period
of many years in which computers existed but were useless for everyday purposes to all but the most
advanced of nerds; and a drastic shift in the balance of global industrial systems. But hey, now you
don’t have to do long division anymore.

(And even with these common things you can see problems creeping in from the edges. Microsoft Word
encountered an unexpected error and your recent changes to Dissertation.docx may have been lost.
Playback error---sorry about that. :/ By the way, this road is under construction. Have you checked
your spam filter?)

If you use any more complicated bit of software, you’re likely to find soon that the comforting
sense of knowing what you’re doing evaporates, and you’re left with the harsh realization that even
though a team of software engineers has spent several years building and refining this program for
you, you still basically need to learn how to code in order to use the program. And even then you
spend half your time just getting errors. Last year I tried to learn a 3D modeling program so
I could make a simple animation of a metal strip bending. After three weeks I had succeeded in
making a wobbly rectangular prism that sometimes stayed put instead of falling through the ground.

Words that one might use to describe the computerized technosphere if one hasn’t dug into it very
deeply are: Convenient. Fast. Simplifies life. Opens new horizons. Words I would use after just
a few years dealing with its other end: Rickety. Swiss cheese. Incomprehensible. Miraculous that it
works. Or to quote Peter Welch’s [“Programming
Sucks”](http://www.stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks):

And now they tell us that we should all start using the Cloud.[^1] Trust us. What could possibly go
wrong?

[^1]: One of the more brilliant extensions you can add to your browser is “Cloud to Butt”, which
    searches news articles you’re reading for any mention of “the Cloud” and replaces them with mentions 
    of “my butt”. Please feel free to imagine this has been applied through the rest of this post.

Actually, that’s not precisely true. No one told you to move your life onto the Cloud. No vacuum
cleaner salesman with the gift of gab ever showed up on your doorstep and told you about how much
better life is when you live on the Cloud. It just kind of happened. Once, you had photo albums in
your house. Then, one day, you woke up to find that when you wanted to look at photos of your life,
instead of opening up a book that’s in a cabinet nearby, you were opening a computer, wading through
a torrent of notifications bidding for your distraction, clicking to request information from
computers owned by Facebook in unknown distant locations, and receiving your photos through the air.
Something similar happened to your old collection of CDs (or vinyls, or mp3s, or cassettes, or all
of them). Who needs all those when you have Pandora or YouTube, which you can get anytime, provided
you’re connecting okay to the internet right now (and when would anyone be offline in the Year of
Our Lord 2017)?

Why did we change this way? Well, because we can do more, of course. On Facebook there’s not just
your photos, there are also the photos of all your friends. On YouTube there’s your music (provided
it’s popular enough and isn’t the Beatles), but then there’s also all this other music you’ve never
heard of, and some of it might be good, and it’s all free, not counting the ads.

Around this part of examining the internet is when we get to the crux of this point I’m trying to
make. The question I’ve been asking myself lately is: Is it worth it? 

Is the benefit of Facebook’s photo sharing worth the psychological shrapnel you have to withstand in
order to use it, plus the price of knowing that in order to access your memories and your friends
you always need the internet? 

Be sure, also, to account in your calculation for the intricately interconnected infrastructure that
brings you the things you want to look at. And the tendency of companies like Facebook and
Google---companies that treat information on humans’ lives as a product they can buy and sell---to
abruptly decide that you can’t do something you’re used to doing.

With that in mind compare Facebook to the old way: a combination of physical photo albums that you
can sit down and tell someone about, plus writing individual letters or \*ahem\* thoughtful blog
posts, plus the occasional phone call to “chat” with someone. Facebook wins hands-down on the score
of convenience, because it’s all there in one place. But which one leaves you feeling like you’ve
made a real connection with someone, and which one leaves you feeling empty and full of craving and
longing?

I’ve been making this calculation with some of the Cloud-based internet things that I’ve used, and
I’ve been coming more and more to the conclusion that it’s not worth it. That it’s time to *back the
hell away* and take back some large swaths of my life that I’d entrusted to the internet.

You may have heard that I’m ditching Facebook. I’m also planning on printing out a bunch of my
photos. And wherever I’ve got data stored on the internet, I’m copying it down to my own lowly
physical hard drive, which is located not in the Cloud but right here on Earth, specifically in my
room where I can keep an eye on it. I’ve long since abandoned Windows 10 and its slew of built-in
spyware in favor of Linux, which tells you what it’s doing and doesn’t send your voice recognition
data (a euphemism for “everything you say in its vicinity”) off to a multinational megabusiness.

And it’s in this same spirit---to finally answer the question I implied in the title---that
I reprogrammed this blog.

That, of course, doesn’t make much sense if you don’t know how the old system worked or how the new
one does. So I’ll sum those up briefly.

**Blogger,** which I just moved away from, is a service run by Google. To write a post I would log
on, type a bunch of words, and press a big “Publish” button. In the course of that I might also
upload some photos. Once the photos were uploaded and the post was published, I had no idea where
they were kept. Basically, they went into a black box kept in an undisclosed location by Google, and
I was allowed to peer in through the keyhole by typing in the right address. If I wanted to do
anything with my posts besides show them on my single Blogger site, my only options were to either
copy-paste them individually from the site (which is error-prone, like photocopying a photocopy), or
download a huge text file with all the information I ever gave to Blogger wrapped into a bristling,
unfriendly package. After 12 years blogging, the file is so massive that it chokes most text
editors; it also doesn’t have line breaks anywhere, and even when you pick through the reams of
cryptic metadata at the beginning of the file to find an actual post, it looks like this:

(By the way, that’s what XML looks like. If you ever see it mentioned, now you know.)

And if I wanted to find out where any single post “lived”, I got the same answer: we’re not telling
you, but here, have this XML dump. It was similar with photos. I had to do some deep sleuthing
before I even found where Google kept them. They’re not, as you might imagine, on the Photos area of
my Google account with the rest of my photos. They *were* there, the last time I checked. But now
they’ve been moved to an invisible zone dedicated to Blogger uploads, and you can only find it
through clicking around in your blog’s backend. I was almost astonished to find that Google had
deigned to include a button I could click to download all my blog photos in one big folder.

One last thing about Blogger: Google doesn’t care about Blogger. It has the distinct scent of
abandonware. Blogspot was the hot new thing when Google bought it in 2003 and rebranded it as its
own; everyone was using their Xanga or their LiveJournal or their GeoCities. Now, with the help of
Facebook and (via YouTube) Google, the internet’s citizenry has been trained to care only about
pictures and videos, not text, and Blogger is a burden from Google’s younger days that they still
have to carry around. You get the feeling that the team in charge of maintaining Blogger has been
reduced to a couple of guys at a card table in a basement of the Googleplex, while the rest of the
company would prefer to imagine that it no longer exists. Since they reorganized as a subsidiary of
Alphabet, Google’s been busy redesigning all their stuff to look sleek and modern. As far as I know,
Blogger was their very last site to get that treatment, and when it finally came, it was full of
misalignments and ugliness on the less-popular pages of the interface, which still haven’t been
fixed. Blogger blogs are so ubiquitous that spambots know them and love them, and as a result Google
has put its strictest spam prevention on these blogs---with the result that real people find it
difficult to successfully comment on a blog, and might lose hundreds of words by submitting
unsuccessfully. About this problem Google appears to care not one whit. It would surprise me only
a little to hear an announcement sometime in the next few years that Google is shutting Blogger down
and everyone’s going to have to figure out somewhere else to move to. That’s the sort of thing
Google does.

**Jekyll** is the name of the new system I’m using. Jekyll isn’t a thing you log on to online; it’s
actually a program you download and run on your computer. Its sole purpose is to take a folder with
a bunch of text files and do a little processing on it to turn it into a blog. The blog it makes is
also just a folder with a bunch of text files; the difference is that they’re text files that make
more sense to Firefox or Chrome, and have the right decorations and menus included. You can toss
them up anywhere that’ll host them. (I use a site called GitHub that makes it extra-easy.) 

{% include fig.html elsewhere=true src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/bored_with_the_internet.jpg"
caption="[xkcd comic #77](https://www.xkcd.com/77) (March 17, 2006)" class="right" %}

And that simplicity is an important difference between a Jekyll blog (a “static site”) and most of
the other blogs and websites on the internet. Most sites these days are ephemeral and immaterial in
a surprising way: the pages that you go to don’t really exist until you go to them. Until you tell
your computer to open up “[www.xkcd.com/77](https://www.xkcd.com/77/)”, that page isn’t all in one
place anywhere. It exists as some entries in a database. What you’re doing is dialing up “xkcd.com”,
and when you ask the computer on the other end of the line for “/77” it very quickly asks its friend
the database for the stuff it’s supposed to show you, then assembles the page right then and there
and sends it to you, then probably forgets everything it just built as a matter of course.[^2]
There’s nothing sitting there waiting for you. It’s all built by machines scrambling like mad to get
the page built in a just-in-time sort of way, and those machines have to always be working or you
get [nothing](https://www.xkcd.com/somethingthatdoesnotexist).

[^2]: Actually, the workings of xkcd might be much more mysterious and subtle. It’s run by an
    extremely nerdy guy who’s probably done some extremely nerdy things with it.

What that boils down to is that, if you have a site that’s like most sites, and it isn’t connected
to the internet and up and running, it doesn’t really exist. I wanted my blog to exist. Jekyll was
the answer.

Once I run Jekyll I can, if I want, look at and change a copy of my blog even if I’m off the grid
and there’s no internet around for miles. I can also pack up the whole website onto a flash drive.
Or I can run some program that turns all the posts into a printable book. The point is, I *have* the
blog. I *have* my data. It’s just a bunch of simple files on my computer that look like this---

[^3]: “And my butt can bugger off.”


I like to think of it as “a blog to outlast the internet.” The internet is unstable. Each year some
old services die or become unusably buggy, and a crop of new upstarts sprouts up. Even though Jekyll
is a thoroughly modern project and this blog uses some pieces that are even more modern than Jekyll,
I’ve got fallbacks for all of them: a series of fallbacks that go from “commenting is inconvenient”
to “here’s a nicely-printed book of some things I wrote on the internet back when there was an
internet”. 

Which is why I spent all that time coding. I learned to use this technology because I’m suspicious
of technology. I reined in my technological use from something that’s easy but complex and
inscrutable to something that’s somewhat more difficult but simpler and doesn’t hide anything from
me. It’s a bit like switching from driving to biking. There are some limitations that I have to
accept, but now I know how to fix the bike (and soup it up) at home with simple tools, because I can
see all its moving parts. And since I’m no longer dependent on Google for gas, I can ride as far as
I want and wherever I want.

It took a lot of effort---it’s never easy to get something into a state of lower entropy---but I’m
glad to have done it before moving off the grid. Now I can write on my own terms. It’s a load off my
mind: one more string of dependence severed between me and the collective cybersphere of the world.

If you’ve read this far and you’re bemused and it all seems a bit irrelevant, just consider what
you’re depending on without thinking about your dependence. What if that thing you’re depending on
were to vanish? It wouldn’t even take the [death of the
internet](http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-death-of-internet-pre-mortem.html)---which
could be many decades in the making---to bring some serious disruptions. Just one site could go
down. Or even something that’s not the internet: your car, for instance.

I’m going out to the land to find the old human memories of how to live without these things. No one
is completely self-reliant in this world, but I’d rather rely on people I know than technologies
I don’t. If you expect the things you depend on to always be there, then I suppose there’s no reason
to learn to do without them. But the more complex something is, the more failure-prone, and a lot of
the systems we depend upon these days are just staggeringly complex. I used to ignore that fact.
I don’t anymore.
