Last week, to make the most of the little time I have left in the USA, I
decided to kind of invite myself over to my friend Ethan’s house in
Chicago, because I figured he’d be the sort of guy who’d have a
good time showing someone around the city. It turned out I was right. He
planned out a big bike trip to go see most of the interesting things in the
city, and I drove up there one Wednesday to visit him. 

Actually, what I did first was go drop off my snake at his new home in
Deb’s basement. My dad has taken care of snakes before, but I trusted Deb
more than him, knowing how Dad is with animals. He has this way of sort of
forgetting about animals until he remembers that they need to be fed, then
feeding them and forgetting about them again. Snakes don’t need to be fed
very often, so if Dad gave Tenzing a big enough bowl of water, he could
conceivably open the cage only two or three times in the whole time I’ll
be gone. This is why I figured Deb was the better bet. Unfortunately, Tenzing
didn’t seem to like her, or maybe he was just in a sour mood from all the
bumping on the car ride up to Chicago. He bit her a few times, which is more
than he’s ever bit anyone before. He took a swipe at me, too, but he
missed. Luckily, Deb is intrepid, and said that Tenzing is small enough that
his bites didn’t even hurt. She told him that she’s soften him up
over the coming year, and he’s just going to have to shove all his hard
feelings aside because she won’t be putting up with them. He’ll do
just fine.

After I explained all the tricks and peculiarities of my giant homemade cage, I
bade Deb and Tenzing goodbye and zigzagged through Chicago to eventually
Ethan’s house. It’s a nice place. They have a trapeze out back, and
a garden on top of their garage. He and his parents and his two little sisters
live there. Ethan made some dinner, which he wasn’t expecting to do, but
his dad told him to, and they fed me, which I certainly wasn’t going to
expect of them, but I didn’t complain. We hung out for the length of the
evening, and then they set me up on an air mattress in the basement (which I
would be testing out for leaks before the family’s big camping trip began
tomorrow morning).

I finally hit the tile floor through the air mattress at about 4:00 in the
morning, but I managed to blow it back up and feel well rested by 8:00 when it
was time to have breakfast and start biking. As far as I know, Ethan has been
biking around Chicago since he first learned how to ride a bike, and by now
he’s got pretty much the whole city memorized. I highly recommend him if
you ever go to Chicago, love to bike, and want a tour of the city. We started
out in his neighborhood, which he’s proud to say is actually within the
city limits and isn’t one of those awful sprawling suburbs. To start out,
we went to the South Side, where he promised we would find good social
commentary. By this he meant we could see the way Chicago is segregated. We
stopped at a Hispanic grocery store for some discount Gatorades, and looked at
all the signs in Spanish. Ethan says a lot of the richer, whiter people he
works with don’t even really realize this part of the city exists.
They’re aware that poor, darker-skinned people live somewhere, but not
that there are entire neighborhoods where they live with each other and the
white people stay away. I was familiar with something like this from
Cincinnati, but I basically only knew of neighborhoods there as
“good” neighborhoods (that is, rich, white, and safe) and
“bad” neighborhoods (mostly black, poor, and the kinds of places
where people warn you that you’ll get shot if you don’t ride
through with tinted windows rolled completely up). Here things were much more
organized, or, to put it more negatively, much more segregated. There was the
Hispanic neighborhood; we also saw a Polish neighborhood and, once we got
lunch, a Chinese one. The lunch was a very American one from a place called
Maxwell Street—hamburgers and Chicago hot dogs, one of each for us starving
cyclists—and we ate it along the Chicago River in a park on the edge of
Chinatown, under a willow near a pagoda-looking shelter.

We were, as it happened, right downstream from a pretty awesome structure: a
lifting rail bridge. But it doesn’t break in half and fold up like most
road bridges that let boats through. Instead there’s a really tall column
on either side of the river, and a section of the bridge gets raised, still
horizontal, about eighty feet into the air. Also, to complete the visual, there
is a house perched on top of the bridge, suspended about twenty feet above the
rail. While we ate our greasy American food, we decided it was unlikely that
we’d be lucky enough to see it raise. Then someone drove a pleasure yacht
right up to it and started clearly waiting.

But we’re dealing with the railroad here; nothing is hurried. So an
Amtrak went over the bridge, then stopped partway across and reversed back to
its original side of the river. Then it did it again. Then a coal train eased
its way leisurely across the bridge. By this time we had long since finished
our food. Once the coal train cleared, we decided to give the bridge five more
minutes to let the poor pleasure-yachter through, because we had a timetable to
keep—Ethan had decided we should take a two-dollar water taxi from this park to
downtown, but we needed to get some Chinese pastries first. About five minutes
later, an Amtrak came across, so we decided to let it go away and then
we’d leave. It got off the bridge. We watched expectantly. Nothing
happened. We biked off. We were almost out of earshot when I heard a siren come
from the bridge, and I turned around to see it raising up. And it was cool
enough to merit the wait and being strung along so long. (It strung us along
one last time, when we were waiting for it to lower again—we were through
waiting for that and had gotten out of the park once more, and then the siren
sounded again.)

The Chinese bakery was interesting. Ethan got some mango pudding, but I decided
to go for weirder things, so I got a “bean paste and walnut cake”
and a sesame cookie. The first thing looked a lot like a big fig Newton, but
instead of fig inside, it was bean paste with walnuts in it. The bean paste
behaved slightly magically: first it didn’t taste like anything. Then it
tasted sweet, almost as if it were a fig Newton after all. Then it tasted like
refried beans, and I had to give the other half to Ethan. I had better luck
with the sesame cookie. I bit into that once we were on the water taxi (a shiny
yellow boat that would take us and our bikes down the Chicago River to
downtown). It tasted like sesame, very much like sesame, and not, as I’d
expected, like a sugar cookie with sesame seeds added on top. I liked it.
I’ve gained a new appreciation for sesame.

We got off the water taxi and hauled our bikes up a big staircase, then rode to
the Bean. Perhaps you have heard of the Bean. It is a giant bean, at least 25
feet tall, that is made entirely of mirror. The reflections are wild. You can
stand underneath the bean, because it arches up, and put your hands on the
wall, and it looks like you’re touching the hands of a duplicate of
yourself that is standing on a wall. You can also examine the entire city in
most parts of the reflection. The Bean is worth seeing. Most of the people in
Chicago appear to have felt the same way, because a whole lot of them were
there, the kind of crowd you’d usually see at a concert or a train
station. Once, I jumped up to see how high up the bean I could plant a
handprint, and a moment later a guy came up to me and said, “Dude, do you
have a phone? I got this sweet shot of you jumping up to the Bean.”
Unfortunately, my phone doesn’t get pictures, but I hope he enjoys it.

Not far from the Bean is the Cultural Center, which Ethan had mentioned to me
once. It’s basically a free art museum and hangout place and hub for
interesting things to do. My favorite art was that of Michael Dinges. He takes
a white thing—a lawn chair, a boat, a dead Macbook. Then he engraves words and
art all over it with a Dremel. The words form anticapitalist,
pro-thinking-your-life-through slogans, often in catchy and ingenious
quatrains. The art is banners, octopuses, snakes—all really well done in the
pointillist style. Michael Dinges is a guy I’d like to be friends with,
based just on the ideas he writes about on these Macbooks.

From there it was time to go up the Hancock Tower. The night before, we looked
at prices for the Sears I Mean Willis Tower. All the customer reviews online
said there was a long wait there, and when you got to the top it was boring,
and then several of them recommended the Hancock Tower instead—it’s 100
floors high, right up there with Sears Or Rather Willis Tower, and apparently
has a better skydeck. So we rode the fastest elevator in North America up to
the top and Ethan showed me all the things we’d seen and all the things
we had yet to see. Unfortunately I had left my glasses in Ohio, but I could
still see most of what he was talking about—though the Bahá’í temple was a
smudge for me. He showed me Oak Park Beach, where we’d be swimming
shortly, and I got to see where the deep parts are and what people look like
from a thousand feet up when they’re swimming. It was one of the better
views I’ve had the opportunity to experience in my life (though the view
from the cliff above Crowduck and the view from the top of Mt Garfield probably
top it).

So we swam. The water was pretty choppy on Lake Michigan that day. Ethan says
that’s what makes it a great challenge—just getting from one point to the
other makes you work good and hard. I, being a river dweller rather than a lake
dweller, was a bit more standoffish, but I got in and swam anyhow, and had a
good time, just in small doses. I got the feeling that Ethan could have swum a
lot longer, but he was accommodating, so we started making our way back to his
house.

On the way we passed some more social commentary, and some railyards, and went
through a hipster neighborhood. In fact we had dinner there. Somewhat on a
whim, we went into a Peruvian place with a not-Peruvian name
(“Between”). It was not what we expected inside. It was dark, and
the tables were either unusually low or unusually high, and there were
partitions all over made out of lots of red strings hanging down from above
(like a hippie bead door, but without the beads). But we decided to give it a
chance, and we both had a Peruvian pasta-meat dish. It was delicious but there
wasn’t enough of it. That was our verdict, I think, on Between.

To assuage this disappointment we stopped by a Tastee-Freez and got enormous
milkshakes that took at least a half-hour to drink. They probably had an entire
normal day’s worth of calories in them. But we were biking, so we could
handle it. (I barely could.) We drank them while walking around in a nearby
park, close to where Ethan grew up, and I climbed on some stuff here and there.
It was dark and we looked out over a pond. Ethan said it always seemed nice to
him, but I could see lights and hear shouting easily from the other side, so it
didn’t seem like a real pond to me, more like a field with water on top.
I guess living in a city gives you different ideas of what counts as a pond.

Finally we biked back to his house. We had biked, Ethan estimates, 40 to 45
miles. Our bodies gave us just enough time to brush our teeth and get our
affairs in order, and then we collapsed. I drove home the next day, sore, but
awfully glad I’d gotten to see the city so up-close and personal with
such a knowledgeable guide. By the way, Chicago is way better in almost every
respect than Cincinnati. (But it doesn’t have Cincinnati chili.)

Besides that, other news includes the fact that I allowed my hair to be cut so
I could look more presentable in the eyes of the Koreans. This was a big thing
for me, because the last time I had any length taken off my hair was in eighth
grade. In probably the majority of my memories, I have long hair. And I still
think of myself as a longhaired person temporarily disguised as a shorthaired
person. But for the time being, I have a short haircut. Victor says it makes me
look like Jerry Seinfeld, which I guess can give you a rough idea of it,
although other people have disagreed with him. Also, I got my visa, and I got
other stuff, and I’m packing up, and it’s getting very close to
time to leave. Wow. It’s crazy.
