I thought you might like to see what EcoHouse looks like. So I took some
pictures. You can click on all these to embigger them.

{% include fig.html src="BookNot 004.jpg" caption="Before it became EcoHouse,
it was known as Stucco House. Note the front yard, which is a prairie. My room
is in the foreground, the one with the plants in the window (those are
Elissa’s). The guy waving from the upper left window is Desi. He thought I was
taking a picture of him. Nope, Desi, just the house." %} 


{% include fig.html src="BookNot 005.jpg" caption="I don’t know who made this
sign (it comes from last year, when EcoHouse was founded), but I approve of it.
However, a girl next door at Dag House (not pictured in this post) refers to us
as “Soth House”, since the sign is spelled Sigma, sideways Omega, Theta." %}


{% include fig.html src="BookNot 006.jpg" caption="The living room is in
reality not this dark and gloomy. It’s a pretty great place to hang out,
especially what with all the recliners and couches. I love reading there." %}


{% include fig.html src="BookNot 008.jpg" caption="Our kitchen, featuring Joe.
Dunno what he was making there. We have two fridges and lots and lots of
cabinet space, which works out great for ten people. It’s a pretty active
place. I’ve learned already that if you have a bunch of vegetables and don’t
know what to cook with them, a good stand-by is stir-fry.  Just drop in a bit
of olive oil and ideally some garlic, and fry it up for maximum delicion.
Elissa’s been supplying us with garlic. Vegetables we can get from our CSA (I
think it’s Community-Supported Agriculture). That’s a system whereby we pay
some money at the beginning of the season, and then get a fat box of fruits and
vegetables every week from a booth at the Farmers’ Market.  Most other things
that we need we can get at the Farmers’ Market, or the local grocery store.
I’ve been using lots of Farmers’-Market-originating vegetables, and eggs too." %}


{% include fig.html src="BookNot 007.jpg" caption="Elissa’s and my room. My
desk is the one without the jacket on the chair. The mess is mostly mine, but
I’ll probably clean it up tonight. The snake cage (far left) has been having
trouble containing the snake, but I think I fixed it yesterday, so he’ll
probably mave out of his interim little terrarium and into his full-time abode
soon. You can see the laptop that I’m typing at right now.  The little Pet
Porter thing below the left side of Elissa’s desk contains her bunny Wilbur.
He’s the biggest bunny ever. Like, respectable-puppy-sized." %}


{% include fig.html src="BookNot 001.jpg" caption="Also, I totally made pasties
last night. They turned out way better than I expected, given my cooking
inexperience. I stuffed them with potato, rutabaga, carrot, onion, garlic, and
basil. They turned out pretty bland-tasting, though, which I’ll correct next
time I make them by adding some parsley from the garden, and other spices. And
probably some meat to mine. I haven’t been there yet, but I understand that you
can buy local beef and chicken at the Phœnix Café in town." %}
