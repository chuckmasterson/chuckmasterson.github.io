It was eight days after I started working at Subway: that is, about two weeks
ago, but I’ve been putting off writing about it, for no particular
reason.

That day I showed up at about 1000, I suppose. Sarah had me take some bread out
of the interesting item that is called the “retarder” and put it in
the proofer, which is where the bread rises for a while. I also chopped some
tomatoes and made some sandwiches. Pretty uneventful. At about 1130 I suppose,
Sarah looked in the proofer and told me with some disdain, “Common sense
says you should season some of these, not just make all white and wheat.”
Seasoning is where you roll the bread in some stuff to make it a different type
of bread, like for example Parmesan Oregano. She hadn’t told me to season
any bread, much less how many of each kind to season. But I apologized anyhow
and she made an interesting gesture that was a combination of a shrug and
“don’t mention it”. I clocked out at 1200, because it was
going to be a slow day and she said I might as well go home. And then she said,
“[Chuck], it’s not going to work out.

I was too jolted to say anything relevant. I just said, “What?”

She said, “You’re not getting it, I don’t see you getting
it…” and trailed off.

I said, “So, do you--want me to come back tomorrow?” She shook
her head no. She said I could bring my two Subway shirts and my apron and hat
up to the store some other time and also pick up my paycheck. I did her one
better and left her everything right then except for one shirt I had at home. I
left her with the enigmatic and underconstructed thought, “I thought I
had something there.”
