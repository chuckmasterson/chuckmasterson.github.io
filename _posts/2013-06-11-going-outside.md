And now I disappear. Today I plan to go to the woods, somewhere in
Maine—possibly a place I found on Google Maps near Belfast—and see what I can
learn by just staying there for several days. Of course, because of
Murphy’s Law, the days that I have available are mostly forecast to be
rainy. But rain is a real part of the wilderness, and I’m learning about
wilderness as it really is. I guess I’ll just have to deal.

Before I leave, I’m going to get some lobster. After I leave, I’m
going to visit Portland a bit, since it’s supposed to be the most livable
city in the country—I’ll figure out what that’s supposed to
mean.

See you on the other end.
