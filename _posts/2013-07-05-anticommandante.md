The Mountain Goats have a song called
[“Commandante”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pKO0gRdNeE) that
goes: 



> I’m gonna drink more whisky than Brendan Behan  
> I’m gonna send my belongings all to Tripoli  
> And I’m gonna ride home to California  
> With a banjo on my knee.  
> I’m never gonna turn off the television  
> I’m just gonna let it run all night  
> I’m gonna plant root vegetables out in the backyard and  
> Come summer I will treat you right, so  
> Put on your Chairman Mao coat  
> And let me clear my throat  
> Let’s turn this whole town upside down  
> ‘Til the coins come falling out of its pocket  
> Yeah, put on your Che Guevara pin  
> And call the troops on in  
> We are gonna sail through the night sky  
> Like a pair of bottle rockets!
> 
> I’ve got a great big secret written down somewhere  
> I’ve got a rosary to protect us both from harm  
> I’ve got a storage locker full of cow figurines  
> And a laundry list of grievances longer than my arm  
> And **I am never going back to Cincinnati!**  
> All those bridges have been burned down to the ground!  
> I’ve got the jet pack strapped to my back and I’m  
> Waiting for you to come around!  
> Yeah! Put on your Chairman Mao coat  
> And let me clear my throat  
> Let’s turn this whole town upside down  
> ’Til the coins come falling out of its pocket  
> Yeah, put on your Che Guevara pin  
> And call the troops on in  
> We are gonna sail through the night sky  
> Like a pair of bottle rockets!

Unfortunately, it looks like I am coming back to Cincinnati. There has been a
problem that I don’t wish to go into, but the upshot is that my backpack
is in Cincinnati and I can’t travel Canada without it. So I’ll be
seaded back for a brief time. And *then* out West. Never fear,
it’ll happen.
