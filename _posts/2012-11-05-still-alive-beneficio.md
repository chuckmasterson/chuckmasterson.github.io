The internet at this place costs 3 euros an hour, so this one is going to be
brief.

It has been a while! I’ve been in a bunch of places where there’s no internet.
First I walked the Way of St James, from the Portugal-Spain border at Valença
do Minho, up to Santiago de Compostela, where they have the tomb of the Apostle
James. It was an incredible experience that I’ll describe more fully at a later
date, as you’ve by now come to expect, I’m sure. Then I hitched very very
slowly to Granada: hitching is terrible in Spain, because the crisis has made
everyone so poor that they can’t afford to go on long trips, meaning that about
90 or 95 percent of the people in any gas station are just going around the
corner. But I got here, and subsequently got to Órgiva, and from there to
Beneficio, a little hippie commune nestled in a steep valley in the desert
canyons and mountains of the Alpujarra. It’s a strange place, but it’s been
growing on me, and tonight I believe I’m going to grill prickly-pear for
everyone.

I took a few moments the other day to figure out a vague schedule for the rest
of my trip. I think I’m going to try to find a farm in the south of France
where I can work for a week or so (might mean stable internet and stories
finally getting written), and then I’ll go to Italy more briefly than Italy
deserves, and then back into France so I can stop off at Paris for a few days
on my way to England. I’m aiming to get into England on about December 4th or
5th, but my plans are all subject to infinite change. You know how it is.

So that’s the last two weeks, or whatever! I’ll try to write again soon. Right
now I’m in town, but I hear there’s a solar-powered internet cafe in the
commune that might actually be cheaper than here.
