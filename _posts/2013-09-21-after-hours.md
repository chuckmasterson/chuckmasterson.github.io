I’m in Portland now, the new Portland, not the Portland I visited in May.
Many people don’t know this: Portland was named after Portland. It makes
sense, right? Because Portland doesn’t even have a port, but Portland
does. Portland isn’t even on the ocean—it’s an hour away—but
Portland is, of course, and they catch lobsters there all the time.
Here’s why we have both Portland *and* Portland. Two guys came to
Portland to found Portland; one of them was from Boston, and the other was from
Portland. When they realized the city they were founding needed a name, they
decided to name it after one of their hometowns. So they flipped a coin, and
the guy from Portland won. And thus was Portland named Portland, after
Portland. 

* * *

But of course, because of the rules, I’m not writing anything about
Portland until I’ve finished and left and gone to Eugene. Instead
I’ve got to catch up on places I’ve been: Glacier National Park,
Missoula, Vancouver, Vancouver Island, Seattle. Actually, I think I’m
only going to do one of those in this post.

* * *

I went to Glacier in the middle of August almost on a whim. I was coming from
Calgary and on my way to Missoula, so it was just right there on the way, and
why not? In fact the road through the middle of the park seemed to be the most
direct way to get to the highway to Missoula. So I hitched a ride from the
border with a guy who happened to be going just that way with his niece, right
through the park. He said he’d probably driven this road, the
Going-to-the-Sun Road, over a thousand times. “This is my commute. Not
bad, huh?” Not bad. All I could do was stare slack-jawed. Sharp, rugged,
jagged mountains; diamond water; patches of glacier up in the altitudes. I
don’t know if I’d seen a glacier before. The guy told me about
everything as we went by; he was the best tour guide I could ask for. He took
me all the way to the opposite side of the park so I could stock up on food and
plan a hike.

Everything was closed by then, but I found a map at least, and used it to
devise a rollicking old hike, untroubled by questions of feasibility because my
map didn’t show how long the trails were. Using the free shuttle system
that the park has put in place (there’s not exactly a lot of parking in
the park, owing to how much of it is vertical), I dropped off my backpack where
I’d be finishing up for the night, then continued up to the Gunsight Pass
trailhead. On the way I’d been examining a somewhat more detailed map of
the park, and discovered that my trail wasn’t going to be the
fifteen-mile stroll I’d thought; it measured in at 21.2 miles. But
I’m not one to back down from an audacious, even foolhardy, plan, so off
I went.

The very first thing I noticed were the berries. They look just like
raspberries, but the plants are completely different. They have a sweet but
also *musky* taste that I loved at first berry. And there were hundreds,
thousands of them, growing right next to the trail! It was probably unwise of
me to eat so many of a berry whose name I didn’t actually know, one after
the other, but they tasted way too good to be poisonous, and anyway I’m
pretty sure there’s nothing poisonous that even sort of resembles a
raspberry. Later I found out they were thimbleberries. They may be my new
favorite fruit.

After a few sprightly, light-on-my-feet miles, walking along a creek, the trail
started ascending, and got out of the trees so I could see the mountains around
me. At the bottom they’re shaped like normal mountains. Their top halves
are basically straight vertical walls until the top. The layers of rock make
occasional narrow shelves, just wide enough for one row of pines to crowd onto,
astoundingly. The heights I was walking started out modest, then steadily got
delirious. I was heading up Mount Gunsight. I started climbing the mountain
proper when I rounded Gunsight Lake, which has untouched waters of a deep,
pristine blue. It’s fed by water crashing in from the glaciers in
braided, waterfalling streams more vertical than horizontal. Occasionally my
path crossed over one of those, and I just had to rockhop or ford it, or get
wet.

Near the top, the trail finally came to one of the glaciers, an unnamed
miniglacier, or perhaps the fractured late-summer piece of a normally coherent
full-fledged glacier. In fact, it crossed it. So not only could I reach down
and touch it—yes, snow in August, it’s real—I *had* to, I had to
walk slipping across it, able to see down fifty feet to the bottom of it, where
I would definitely slide and probably die if I lost my footing. It was a rush,
let me tell you.

After a neverending series of switchbacks, I got to Gunsight Pass itself. (No
summiting today; I was fine with that.) At the top was a little cabin, but I
preferred to eat my lunch-dinner of trail mix in the teeth of the wind coming
in from the other side of the Continental Divide. I sat there just steps away
from where water splits to go either to the Gulf of Mexico or to the Pacific
Ocean. The wind tried to steal my sunflower seeds.

And then I started the second half, on schedule to get back by about 10:00.
Except I hadn’t realized there was more uphill, not just a slow descent
to the gold. But I wasn’t too worried about that as I walked by Lake
Ellen Wilson and flushed prairie dogs and heard them raise their peeping alarm
calls. I saw mountain goats. Two of them, an adult and a kid, twenty feet above
the trail, grazing and climbing nonchalantly away from me. And half an hour
later, rounding the far edge of Mount Gunsight, I came to a hairpin and heard
something aggressively yanking on the grass. Just a few feet from me—a mountain
goat. I lost my breath. Its friend popped into sight too. I could see the
expressions in their eyes—bemused, maybe, chewing and wondering what I was
doing there. If I’d had the brass, I could’ve reached out and
touched one, but their forbidding horns kept me away. They were in my way, but
they moved, disregarding the looseness of the rock and the vertical pitch of
the slope, as if walking up walls were just no thing. And I saluted them and
walked on. I should’ve started this hike at about seven in the morning,
sure, but since I was so late, I was the only hiker out, and all the wildlife
was coming out. I decided that if I got to greet mountain goats personally, I
was all for seeing the wilderness after-hours.

I crested a notch and finally started my long descent; I went by the Sperry
Châlet and saw all the foppish folke gadding about, and used their bathroom;
then it started getting dark. Thank goodness for that bright moon. And for all
the songs I know the lyrics to, which put my mind a little at ease, since
I’d heard that being boisterous is how to avoid sneaking up on a bear.
Even in the dark I came across a little more wildlife—a toad on the path, big
and dusty. I managed not to lose the trail, and at 10:50 I finally made it back
to the Lodge to retrieve my backpack. I got it, and some advice on where to
stealth camp (I was happy to learn that along the beach would be a fine place),
and I found sandwiches in the trash, which were perfectly placed and really
satisfying. And that night I slept a long time..
