Okay! Let’s get into it. This is going to be a long series of entries. In
this one I’m only covering the very beginning, abstracting heavily from
my journal, but I’ll pick up the pace after this now that I’ve got
the background and the basics covered. There are a few pictures, but I expect
I’ll be putting up most of them in a series of posts especially for
pictures. 

I woke up while it was still dark. It was cold in my room because I
didn’t bother with heat on that last night. I sat in the cold,
communicated with people on my computer, then turned it off and unplugged it
and unplugged everything else I could find to unplug in my room. I brought
along exactly two pieces of cold-weather clothing: my blue plaid long-sleeve
shirt and my plaid pajama pants. When I was choosing these, I was only thinking
about practicality and I forgot to consider that if I ever had occasion to wear
them both together, I would look like a clown. Looking like a clown, I walked
down to the bus stop and took the morning bus to Seoul, then a train to the
airport, and left this little country for the first time since May, (unless you
count my tour of half of a room in North Korea).

Shortly I was in Beijing, where there was
snow on the ground outside and cold air inside, and while waiting for the
flight to Bangkok I met a guy who’d brought along his bubble coat and was
comfortable now but was going to have to carry it around for his entire sojourn
in the tropics. I felt pretty good about my decision to pack light. I brought
one backpack with me, with no checked luggage. The backpack had three T-shirts
(one of which I lost later—sorry, Mom, it was one of your tie-dyes, but I still
have another here) and two pairs of shorts, plus my journal, a guidebook,
glasses, and my toothbrush and toothpaste. Tied below was a sleeping bag, and
that’s all. In my securely zippered vest pockets I carried my passport,
my credit card, all my money (about $670 US plus $167 worth of Thai baht), my
camera, and my itinerary. Still, I often felt like I had too much stuff. I
could’ve gotten by without the flimsy green blank book in my other vest
pocket that I used for scratch paper, for example.

I stepped out of the plane at
Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport and after escaping from the secure zones I
passed this sign:

I was in a very different country.

I latched onto a Caribbean woman
I’d met at the Beijing Airport and, since all the buses stop after
midnight, we shared a taxi to Khao San Road. Khao San is a street that you can
walk down in two minutes, or you could if it weren’t for the extremely
drunk people swarming it, wandering from bar to bar, and the pad Thai stands
set up in the middle of the street all along its lengths, which you often see
being moved from one place to another for whatever reasons, and the men trying
to hand you cards telling you where you can buy fine tailored suits, cheap
beers, and whores. Its name (which incidentally means “milled
rice”) is familiar instantly to every Westerner traveling in Thailand or
any country vaguely near it. I wasn’t expecting this when I arrived
there; I only knew it from my guidebook (Lonely Planet’s *Southeast
Asia on a Shoestring*, borrowed from Sean) as a place where there were a lot
of cheap guesthouses. I wasn’t really paying attention to the part where
it mentioned bars. Half overwhelmed, I got a pad Thai and walked from one end
to the other with my Caribbean friend while she looked for guesthouses, but
they were all too expensive, so I left her to her expensive one and asked drunk
people for tips on where to pay a bit less. Someone semicoherently directed me
to a street a little ways away and I found a lot of hostels that were all full,
finally ending up at a peaceful, white place on a sixth floor. I soaked myself
in the shower to rinse off the sweat I’d sweated since stepping into the
breathy air of this tropical country and fell asleep.

I woke up to my first day ever of
independent traveling. Wherever I’ve gone before—Canada, Oregon, Costa
Rica, that road trip around the West when I was 12—I’ve always had older,
more experienced people calling the shots for me, booking all the motel rooms,
stopping the car at reasonable-looking dinner places, and above all, deciding
all the destinations. Now here I was in Bangkok with a little plan written out
on a third of a sheet of paper and not a lot of confidence in it. Bangkok!
It’s a place that exists in newspaper articles and surreal hearsay
stories, but now here it was in real life, six stories below me. I just stared
for a while, and then snapped a few pictures of how different it was, feeling
like the strangeness was fleeting and I needed to make sure I caught it before
Bangkok turned into Iowa City. I took a picture of some roofs from my window.

But almost everything in the city was more interesting than those roofs.

I went
downstairs with no plan except to see whatever I could of Bangkok before about
5:00, when I would meet someone. At first all I could think of was my
very brief time in San José. Of course, that was a bad comparison, based only
on the fact that it’s the only other tropical city I’ve visited. I
wandered confusedly toward Ko Ratanakosin, the area where all the old treasures
and landmarks are. I found a big grass mall and didn’t understand it, and
I walked along the street looking at anything that seemed interesting. Many
people tried to scam me. One person succeeded. She was an old lady feeding corn
to the pigeons. I was looking around, clearly clueless, and she took the
opportunity to press three little bags of corn into my hands. I tried to give
them back with a “That’s okay,” but she said
no—”Feeding, feeding.” It seemed like a fun enough thing to do, and
probably associated somehow with good luck, since she seemed like she was
having a good time doing it on her own. I suspected at first that it was a
scam, but she wasn’t aking for money, so I naively supposed she might
not. After I emptied the bags into the aggressive flock of pigeons, she said,
“Money.” She wanted 50 baht, about $1.60. Then she changed it and
wanted 50 baht per bag. Then she calculated my bill for four bags, not three,
and she and a man who suddenly showed up to enforce things lifted 200 baht off
of me. I could eat for days on that kind of money! Here was my introduction to
the importance of being careful and on guard. Much later, I became thankful
that I learned the lesson so cheap. Other people told me stories of actually
buying the fine tailored suits since they seemed like such a good deal, or
accepting a courtesy ride to the sights around town that actually turned out to
be a 1500-baht ride. At $6.50, I got off pretty light.  

Anyhow, somewhat bitterly I continued toward Ko Ratanakosin, with no
particularly clear destination in mind except maybe the Chao Phraya River. I
found the famous and recommended royal palace and emerald Buddha, but they
wanted a steep admission charge to get into the complex, so I figured there
would be other good sights elsewhere in the district and kept wandering. I
found myself at something labeled the City Pillar Shrine. I had no idea what it
was. It turned out to be quite a few things. First was a stage where four women
in golden spire hats were doing a dance that involved lots of moving their
hands around in slow motion and striking poses. While they danced, two old men
played marimbas tured to unfamiliar scales and another man played finger
cymbals. I allowed myself to become entranced. This was when I started enjoying
Thailand. Nearby was a temple with a Buddha shrine, and a lot of people inside
bowing their heads to the ground in front of it. Next to it, under tents, there
were people decorating Buddha statues. In one, they were tying rainbow-colored
ribbons around him. In the other, they were pressing little rectangles of gold
leaf onto the statue. Some of it came off, so there was literally gold floating
around the air, bits of it everywhere like dust. It mixed with the incense. I
just watched, eyes and mouth open.  

Feeling a bit more positive, I left and eventually stumbled across a big
complex of spires and shelters that was almost devoid of people. Access was
through a driveway nearly corked up by a pickup truck. This was weird, because
in order to get there I’d followed a little stream flanked by either lane
of a thoroughfare, and despite not having any temples or anything besides
houses and businesses, that stream was teeming. There were families sitting in
the grass, a woman peeing in the street behind a car, and a bunch of people
wafting incense at an elephant-shaped shrine built to commemorate the fiftieth
birthday of some long-dead queen. Now here I was among dozens of spires and
buildings all lavishly decorated over every inch with details upon details, the
whole place a series of intricate patterns and artwork, all finished by hand,
adding up to years of work, and I had it to myself.  

I
saw another Westerner, taking pictures. He was just as surprised as me at the
emptiness there. I relayed to him the information some Europeans gave to me on
my way in, that it was called Ratchabophit, and we got to talking. Mostly it
was about traveling. He was only the first of many other travelers I met and
talked about traveling with, but I never did get tired of it. He’d just
been in Nepal for several months and made it sound like an amazing place. Now
he was traveling on funds from teaching English in Korea, and when they ran out
he would start teaching in Vietnam. We decided to walk around together for the
duration of the evening—our combined senses of direction might be less easily
befuddled. His name was Glenn. We went around looking for Wat Pho, which was
supposed to be good, but came to some interesting-looking temples first, and
inquired about admission prices. They were $3, and it looked good, so we got
tickets and discovered upon being given a map that we had just entered Wat Pho.
I was beginning to get pretty familiar with Buddhist holy architecture. The
grounds were littered with dozens of spires—stupas, they call them—each one
covered in tiled flowers, ceramic, colors, and spearing into the sky. Again,
each one represented years of devotion by some unknown artist. We turned a
corner and found ourselves in a courtyard whose walls were lined with seated
Buddha statues, lining the walls like a guard watch from the country of King
Midas. There were also statues of bearded men, men in awesome hats, dragons,
sheep, and many more things that were probably residents of the Buddha mythos
but unfortunately not the real world. We turned a corner again and found the
building that’s the home of the largest reclining Buddha in the country,
passing into final Nirvana. His ear was nearly as big as me. He was smiling
inscrutably or serenely, it was hard to tell which, and lying there stretched
out so far behind so many columns that I couldn’t see all of him. There
was a clanking and clattering in the air. I reached his feet, which were
decorated with a matrix of auspicious symbols, without figuring out what it
was, and then came around the other side of the Buddha and found people
dropping coins one at a time into a long row of black bowls.  

We covered the rest of Wat Pho this way, then looked for the river. It
was surprisingly hard to find. In Seoul there are (so far) 27 bridges across
the Han River, but in Bangkok the Chao Phraya has been bridged about twice.
Also, between the riverfront streets and the actual river are impenetrable rows
of buildings, so you can’t stroll along the banks. After some lunch, we
persisted and found the launch for the ferry that crosses the river, which is
something they have there instead of a bridge. It took us to Wat Arun. More
than anything else we’d seen today, this was a building composed entirely
of patterns. Flowers, people or monsters holding up the next level, animals,
friezes, mandalas, more things than I could count. I climbed up to the top and
looked out over the boats whizzing up and down the Chao Phraya with their truck
engines and elfin prows.  

We returned, now halfway exhausted by the heat and the walking, and had
some cold beer and talked about stuff. Then at 5:00 I had to say goodbye so I
could keep my appointment, which was with Mom’s old student Yoshi. (Yes,
it’s a Japanese name—he moved to Bangkok for business.) He came down to
Tha Tien Pier straightaway (in a van that I later learned was owned by the
company and driven by a professional driver because Bangkok traffic is so
chaotic that ordinary mortals are often not trusted with the wheel), though the
distance meant that I also got to have a chat with some tuk-tuk drivers. A
tuk-tuk is a little three-wheeled contraption with motorcycle-inspired controls
at the front and an open-air roofed enclosure for passengers at the back. The
word is an onomatopoeia for the sound of their engines. I never tuk a picture
of one, but here’s one from the internet.  


{% include fig.html src="Tuk-Tuk.jpg" %}

The drivers are usually aggressively asking every passerby, “Hey, you need
tuk-tuk?” But once I told these guys that I was waiting for a friend, they
stopped thinking of me as a mark and turned out to be great people. One guy got
on the topic of booze and said, pointing to another driver, “My friend drink,
so much. White tongue!” His friends laughed. And I more or less understood, and
laughed too. And finally, I was interacting with the locals on a chatting
level, not a business level.

Yoshi appeared and we got reacquainted—I hadn’t seen him for at
least 12 years—and he with tremendous friendliness took me to a swanky
restaurant called The Deck that overlooked the river. We watched the sun go
down behind Wat Arun (which ironically means “Temple of Dawn”).
Sparkling boats chugged down the river. The air was cool and refreshing. We ate
delicious Thai food and talked about languages and countries and got along
great. Then, once we were done, he kept going with his generosity by driving me
(that is, having me driven) to the bus station. He helped me buy a ticket to
Chiang Mai, too, and because he’s good at Thai and I was lucky, I got
bumped up to a VIP bus. We said goodbye and I sat around waiting, then got on
the bus, where I finished out my first day of traveling by falling asleep. I
was starting—just starting—to pick up the rhythm of this life.
