I took a nine-day tour of the Gobi Desert and the Mongolian steppe. Tomorrow, I
suspect, I’ll have the time to do a big post about the experience -- though
maybe not the whole thing. It’s starting to seem kind of silly to me, for some
reason, to write about everything in great detail right after I do it. I’m
probably going to change modes: I’ll tell one good story from the time since
the last update, and give everything else in outline. That way I won’t have to
set aside, like, ten hours every week or two to write a bunch of blog posts on
a hostel computer. Right now, though, I’m not even doing that… I’m just
checking in to say that I’m back, and I’ve even showered. Pretty soon I’ll be
off to dinner and then a show (that same band again -- this time I’m the one
introducing other people to them). Tomorrow I have some time to kick back a
bit. Then hopefully I’m off into the bush again.
