I’ll probably have time to blog in decently descriptive detail about what
I did in Glacier National Park (that was before the pears) and Vancouver (that
was after). But for now, I’m just letting you all know that I’m in
Seattle, and I’m sleeping under an actual roof. Remember that guy Darwin
that I stayed with when I was living in New York in 2010? Well, he just moved
to Seattle a month ago, and when I sounded my Facebook “Where am I going
to sleep in Seattle?” call, he invited me over for a couple nights until
I find someone who can have me over longer. I haven’t figured out where
that’ll be yet, but I have a few different leads.

Some might say I’m freeloading. That’s not really right. The only
things I’m getting for free right now are things that wouldn’t have
been used anyhow: the overnight use of the couch here, a safe couple of square
feet to keep my backpack, a bike that was left in the basement by the previous
residents of this house. And I’m not taking anything. I supply my own
food. I dumpstered a bunch of absolutely fine sandwiches last night, so I
haven’t been hungry at all. I suppose I used a little soap, shampoo, hot
water, and laundry detergent, but that’s practically a negligible cost.
And meanwhile I’ve been giving back.

Darwin lives with four other people, all of them volunteers at various places
in the city. One of them—I think her name is Brin—was trying to pump up her
bike tires last night, and getting nowhere. “Darwin’s friend, do
you know more about this bike pump than I do?” she asked.
“Maybe?” I said. I took a look at it. The tubing was broken open
near the nozzle; I showed her.  “Can that be fixed?” she said. It
looked pretty grim. But I took an analytical eye to the problem, and pried the
nozzle apart with my Leatherman, trimmed the cracked part off of the end of the
tubing, and put the nozzle back on. She was impressed. “You’re
quite handy!” she said.  “Any other problems I can solve with my
Leatherman?” I asked.  “I can’t think of anything. I’ll
have to start breaking things,” she said. But I felt like with that, and
with the dumpstered sandwiches that they welcomed with fascinated open arms
into their fridge, I’ve at least earned my keep. I don’t take
without giving. The people who do that are the beggars on the sidewalks and the
onramps, and though a lot of them don’t deserve that fate, a lot of them
also do, because for whatever reason they feel like the world owes them, and
all they need to do is stand and collect it. I try to keep my karma in balance.
That’s why I still have friends, and that’s why I’m not
asking you for your spare change.
