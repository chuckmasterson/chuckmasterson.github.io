I’ve been realizing for the last few days that I needed to do another post, not
having done one for about a week and a half. So here it is. I don’t know
exactly why I waited so long, but I do know that I’ve always liked to
procrastinate, so that might have something to do with it.  

The main thing that happened over the last week and a half is that the band
went to State. This in and of itself is remarkable, because we’ve never done
this before. The Finneytown Marching Band has never gone to state. Okay. So we
went to state this year, a two-hour drive. Here’s where it gets interesting.  

It was a knd of cold evening, but not too cold, and the stadium lights were
shining bright on the band that was on before us. They did some swing music.
While we waited for them to finish, we were getting adrenaline rushes like
nothing before. We’d been training for this for over four months, and this was
the culmination of our entire marching band season. The other band marched off
the field, and we marched on.

If we thought we had a lot of adrenaline before, it was nothing compared to
what we got as we marched out of preset. Preset is the most intimidating part
of a show, in my opinion. I don’t know why, but there’s something about it that
starts your heart pumping like Hoover Dam. All the rest of the show, I can
handle. And, in fact, I did. I did it pretty well, too. I always screw up just
minimally during the opener and then correct it all during the last three
songs. That’s what happened there. It was tense the whole time, though. Imagine
the feeling you get when you’re riding your bike across a street and a big van
comes out from behind a truck, braking with a screech and a honk about five
inches from you. Then imagine that feeling for eight straight minutes. That’s
the show, boiled down to its raw elements.

I was certainly glad to march off the field and change into my civilian
clothes. From the buses where we did that, I went to the stadium and met Dad,
who gave me $five to buy a shirt about the competition; then I watched a few
more bands from on the bleachers (which were several stories high) while
sitting with Kimber and Matt and Krystal. Kimber likes horses; Matt likes
computers and stuff; Krystal is deranged. I gave them my personal play-by-play
on how the bands out were doing. Then, when it was time for the awards
ceremony, we realized we were on the exact opposite side of the field from
where we were supposed to be, and while we were on our way to the other
bleachers they called out the scores. We got a I.

A I is the highest rating possible. It was nearly unfathomable that Finneytown
could come out of nowhere and then get a I, but we still did it. As we found
later, we were one of only five class “B” bands out of 22 to get a I. The buses
were hard pressed to stay together all the way home.

Besides that, not much happened. Really not very much whatsoever. I’m going to
go now. ,Bye’
