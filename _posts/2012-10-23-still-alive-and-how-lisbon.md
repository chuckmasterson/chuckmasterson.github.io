It’s becoming clearer and clearer to me that blogging long stories is
pretty difficult, because the time to do it just doesn’t really exist. I
don’t know when I can get around to writing about my Czech adventure. So
as to not keep you completely on tenterhooks, I’ll sum it up briefly: 

*   Got a ride with an incredibly pleasant guy named Tomáš who sounds like Jim
    Carrey in _Dumb & Dumber_ when he talks in English, and has the body
    language to match.
*   Found out that the place I was planning on sleeping was no longer available
    to me, whereupon Tomáš promptly offered his house.
*   Went to a bar with Tomáš’s friends, and arranged to go fishing with some of
    them the next day, and climbing the day after that.
*   Fished and caught the only fish of the day, a pike. We weren’t particularly
    dedicated about fishing, beer was more the order of the day.
*   Got up the next morning and went with one of Tomáš’s friends named Martin
    to a natural climbing wall in Roviště, on the Vltava (=Moldau) River, and
    became absolutely exhilarated by the process of climbing. I must do this
    again.
*   Stayed in a dorm with one of Martin’s friends, and explored the enormous,
    abandoned Strahov Stadium.

As you can see, there’s a lot more of this story to be told. Someday! If
no other time, then at Christmas. 

Anyhow, I’m currently in Lisbon, soon to get some directions for how to
take the Way of St James *northward* to Santiago de Compostela. Of course
-- Portuguese pilgrims take this path too! I just had a joyous two and a
half days with Grandma and Grandpa, eating more than I could eat, and also
talking for hours and hours and enjoying being with them. It had been so long.
Now I can hardly wait to get home. I guess maybe when I get on the pilgrimage
path it’ll get out of my system, but for now I almost wish it were
Christmas already.

I’m just about out of time at this internet cafe, so I’ll leave it
at that.
