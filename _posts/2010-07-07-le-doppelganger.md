(This is my second post today, because I couldn’t resist. It’s small. The other
one meatier.)

Here in Kane’s house I have found my Doppelgänger. The only trouble is I’ll
never get to meet him and compare notes, because he died in 1877. Even so, what
do you think?

{% include fig.html src="Gustave_Courbet_auto-retrato.jpg" %}

*Before*

{% include fig.html src="Le Courbet 007.jpg" %}

*After*

He was Gustave Courbet, 1819–1877, a French painter. I found him on the cover
of a big book full of his paintings by the fireplace. I was transfixed.

This means we can expect that when I’m forty or so, I’ll look like this:

{% include fig.html src="Gustave_Courbet.jpg" %}

I fully intend to find a proper coat and take this picture at that time.
