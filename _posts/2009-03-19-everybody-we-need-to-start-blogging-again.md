And it has been a while, too. It’s been a busy few weeks, the last ones before
spring break, resulting in oogobs of work piling up. Actually, it wasn’t all
that bad, because most of my professors seemed to think we were probably being
overloaded by our other professors, and so they compensated by giving me a
lightish workload. There was only one class that had a whole bunch due -- my
sociology class, for which I had to do a 4-page paper and a take-home exam
within a week of each other. So there was only one night where I stayed up
really late. I ended up going to bed at 6:15 AM that night. So I got about one
REM cycle, which is better than zero. The good thing is that I get two weeks of
spring break, but the bad thing is that I have a 7-page paper to write sometime
before I get back in town. I’m going to make a sincere effort to get that done
before this weekend, so I don’t have to think about it later.  

What other stuff happened before I left? Oh, here’s one. I got accepted to live
in EcoHouse for my second semester next year. EcoHouse is a college-owned
project house whose residents strive to make as little impact on the
environment as they can while being college students also. This isn’t Trendy
Green stuff, like “Put in compact fluorescents!” and “Recycle a little more!”.
It’s well-considered actions that do more than just make the residents look
Green. For example, EcoHouse is big about buying local foods to as great an
extent as possible. A couple people last year actually went on a 100-mile diet,
where everything they ate came from within a 100-mile radius (except for a few
little things like coffee and sugar). I don’t know what they ate (corn, corn
byproducts, corn derivatives, corn extracts), but they didn’t ship in every
meal from halfway across the globe. Relatedly, there’s a garden out back, which
we’re expanding 44% for next year, and which will grow tomatoes, squash,
various spices, pumpkins, lettuce, carrots, cabbage, and all sortsa other good
stuff. The garden is fed with compost from the house’s meals, which the
EcoHouse people cook themselves a good deal. There’s one meal every week,
Sunday evenings, where the whole house gets together and cooks a meal and then
has a meeting to talk about how the week went for everyone, and what chores
still need to be done, and what debts need to be settled, and so on. The house
has been renovated to be more water- and energy-efficient: low-flow toilets,
sinks, and showerheads; an energy monitoring system and soon some window quilts
to keep warm (or cold) air in. I think I’m really going to like living there.  

Press has started working on its projects for this semester. We have three: a
set of postcards from around the college, a book of photography of subtropical
animals (the photographer went to Costa Rica and Florida for a college thing),
and a fantasy novel that takes place in the land of Insanity, and whose
protagonists are two kids who were a little bit too crazy for Reason, so the
elves snatched them away. I’ll be sure to bring everyone copies. They’re all
fun.  

I visited the Amana Colonies with my intentional communities class. Our
professor is pretty much the premier scholar on the Amanas -- in one of the
pieces he gave us to read, a guy wrote about them, and cited Professor Andelson
almost exclusively, except for a newspaper columnist from the 1800s. So we had
a good and informative tour, especially since Professor Andelson teamed up with
Lanny Watts of the Amana Heritage Society. (I just looked up how to spell
Watts, and in the Amana Heritage Society I only found references to Lanny
Haldy, so I don’t know exactly Watts up with that.) I bought some Millstream
root beer, and it was very tasty. At first I didn’t think it was all that
great, but it grew on me. I like that it uses real sugar, not corn syrup.  

I worked at CERA a few times. Once, our manager Larissa (“our” being mine and
Jacob’s -- he’s an EcoHouse guy who works there too this semester with me) had
an owlet with her, because someone she knew had found it on his farm, injured.
Larissa was keeping it at CERA for a while because it was closer to where she
was going to take it eventually, a raptor rehabilitation place. It was a very
cute owlet. Owlet! If you’re ever depressed, Google for pictures of owlets. I
just did it, and I think they’re even cuter than kittens.  

I also worked at Bob’s. One night, there was a big party in the lounge next
door. One very drunk guy came in while I was playing 碁[^1] with a friend in
the dining area, and he asked if he could get some water from the tap. I said
sure, so he went over to the sink. After a few moments, he called over to me,
“It’s not working.” “You’re maybe turning it the wrong way?” I told him, and
went over to look. It transpired that he had been trying to use the soap
dispenser.  

I’ve also started training to be a leader for GOOP next year. You may recall
that I applied to be a GOOP leader last year, but I didn’t get in. This year
they kind of couldn’t refuse me, since I worked at Manito-wish last summer. It
looks like it’ll be fun. I’m definitely looking forward to it. We’ve only had
one training session so far, where we talked about blisters and sunburn and CPR
and such. Unfortunately for my Spain trip, the two don’t look like they can
both happen next year, and I have to say that I’m probably going to side with
GOOP. However, Aunt Irene, I did appreciate you sending me that letter that you
wrote for Leah. I do hope to go overseas sometime, but it looks like I might
not do it for a college semester. I guess that’ll leave me room to do something
a little more unstructured, which may well give me a better opportunity to
experience the culture anyhow. Maybe I’ll even do the stereotypical
college-student thing and go backpacking around Europe for a while after I
graduate -- who knows.  

And, I’m going to be turning twenty in six days. That, to me, is really weird.
I wrote something about it in my journal a couple days ago:

I haven’t done much with my spring break yet. I’ll put up bulletins as it goes
by. A few fun things are definitely going to happen. Meanwhile, since I was
looking at my journal, I’ll put out something else I found in there:  

I dreamt that I was going to do something dangerous on my bike, and that I knew
I might lose a leg doing it, but I did it anyhow. I did lose a leg, the right
one. So did a woman named Ida Mose, and a guy I didn’t know. We commiserated.

[^1]: That’s “go”, but I like to use the Japanese character, because it’s hard
    to confuse it with the verb “go”.  

[^1]: Followed by “The Parenthood Decade”, “The Mid-Life Crisis Decade”, “The
    Working a Lot Decade”, “The End-of-Work and Free-Time Decade”, “The Last Hurrah
    Decade”, “The Rest Home Decade”, the “Extra Innings Decade”, and any following
    decades would be part of “The Your-Days-Are-Numbered Era”. This is purposely a
    very pessimistic classification system.  I’m sure things look much better from
    down the road a ways.
