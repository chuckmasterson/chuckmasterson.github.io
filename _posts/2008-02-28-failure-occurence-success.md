I was prepared to accept failure on my shoelessness bill. But I wasn’t
expecting it to crash quite so hard. It got the fewest yes votes of all the
initiatives on the ballot: 22%. It also got a significant number of no-opinion
votes, and I think about 65 to 70% no votes. I was really surprised. I never
thought such a hippie place as Grinnell would be so unprogressive on an issue
like barefooting. Yesterday, I did an interview with a guy from KDIC, the
college’s radio station, and I think I pinpointed the problem: everyone here is
probably only really progressive on the big, world issues, and doesn’t really
give a whole lot of thought to different viewpoints on small issues like
barefooting. Yes, there are more important issues, but as long as you’re
voting, why not give barefooting a yes?

I applied to be a GOOP leader next year. A few days later, I got a letter back
saying that they had so many very qualified and experienced applicants that
they had to make some very difficult cuts and we’ll let you know if anything
opens. I told them to please, please let me know. Nothing has opened. This
summer, I’ll apply to some sort of camp. Maybe Manito-wish.

I ordered an album in the mail and got it. It’s really good: *The Sunset Tree*.
It’s by The Mountain Goats, who came here before winter break, and I saw them
in concert then. I like it a bunch, especially “Dilaudid”.

I made that snow sculpture. Here is a picture.

making it.
