I’m typing this hunt-and-peck on the Dvorak keyboard layout, so I’m going to be brief. Handily, I have a camera that I can now use to tell most of the story. 

I’m back in Grinnell; Mom and I drove here yesterday and stayed at a motel last night. I recently closed out an old bank account. Check out how loaded I am.

Other stuff:

The ugly dog.

My favorite cat.

My night-blooming cereus: it’s growing a new, sturdy branch (bright green in center)! And another new one is sprouting (not visible here because it’s so tiny)!

That’s it for now.
