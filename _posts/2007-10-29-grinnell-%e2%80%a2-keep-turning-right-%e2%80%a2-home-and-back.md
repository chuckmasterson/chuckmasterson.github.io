I finished with Mom’s ginger snaps, and transfered my peanut butter fudge
into the tupperware they were in. I left that on my dresser.  

Today I went to calculus. When I came back, something leapt off my dresser; it
paused on the windowsill and I saw it was a squirrel. Then I saw this:

Luckily, I seem to have chased it off before it was able to get to any of the
fudge. However, probably some fudge disappeared while it was in the box that
Nana & Papaw shipped it to me in. I didn’t keep that closed. That’s
Grinnell.

* * *

Let’s listen to a tale of Rock Creek. [Mostly excerpted from my journal
directly after the fact]  After I made that last blog, I put on some longer
clothes, failed to get a Maid-Rite (they were closed; I had to have a sub
instead), and started biking. It was a very different ride by daylight. There
seemed to be a lot fewer hills now that I could see the whole hill each time.
It was tough going when it was uphill, because I was fighting the wind too. But
I got there in good time.

I started off at the same place I was last time, which was, it seems, a mooring
dock for sailboats and stuff, but it was out of season. I eventually found a
place to get water, which I needeed, because in my hasty non-planning I
didn’t bring a water bottle. It was a well, and I had to kneel down to
drink out of it, but that was fine. So then I set off to find good krokay. The
trail around the perimeter of the lake is nothing llike straightforward. I kept
getting whisked away from the shore whenever I got close. However, I did find a
couple good spots. It looked like I had come to a dead end, but then I found
the “Multiuse Trail”. It wasn’t a short trail from one point
to another, I discovered, but rather a long ad spderwebbing trail with more ups
and downs than a roller coaster, and steeper too. Frequently I found myself
hurtling into an invariably mud-filled low point in te trail. This was often
filled with sharp rocks for no discernible reason but to make me nervous about
my tires. Just as often, I had to power up a 45° incline, which was often also
muddy. I only kinda kept in view of the lake. I found a few good krokay spots,
but realized that it would be ridiculous to bring krokay equipment this far
just on foot. I mean, that stuff is heavy. Ovvasionally, -- two or three
times -- the trail dumped me out into the collective back yards of a
lakefront neighborhood. I also ran into a few more dock-type things. The last
neighborhood had a large, wavy field behind all the houses, and te field was
_covered_ with Canada geese. There were probably 300 of them. I was getting
worn out frm the ups and downs, so I moved onto the paved road instead. It took
me up to a gravel higway. THe sky was getting darker for the night. As I biked
down that road, I realized I’d gotten pretty far afield of the lake.
Finally I saw it off in the distance, at the bottom of a big giant hill. THere
was agracel loop that went to it -- or so it seemed. It was actually just
a vantage point, and got nowhere near the lake itself. I moved on, looking for
a better way to get to the lake. But the road just moved farther and farther
away. I turned around and went back to the gravel loop. There was a chain
around it, but I was determined to get back to the lake, so I lifted my bike
over and rolled down a hill all the wy to the shore, tall yellow grass smacking
me in the face the whole way. But, skirting the shore, I had found a trail.
Yes. So I followed that around the shore. I had realized long ago that I would
circle the lake, or most of it (there’s a bridge that crosses it --
sort of like a long pier that goes all the way across, at a narrow part). From
the view I got I was a little more than halfway done. I had miles left,
probaby. But I kept going. It was pretty smooth, and the trail was pretty good
for biking at least compared to the trails earlier. But it never seemed to end.
And it never came near anything that wasn’t forest. I was getting
exhausted. And it was getting hard to see. The trail had lost sight of the
lake, but I kept turning right so I knew I must be following the shoreline at
_some_ remove. Still, I could now see nothing but the trail a little ways
ahead, and even that was getting dim. I stopped and caught my breath, took off
my zip-off sleeves. I was hot. I had been biking aong this trail for what
seemed like a half-hour, surely, and probably all of one -- I wasn’t
checking my watch. There were no lights to be seen, except one, which, as I got
closer to it, turned out to be totally out of my way. I couldn’t see the
road, couldn’t see anything but trees. I didn’t know if this trail
led anywhere. For all I knew, it was taking me to the middle of Iowa via a
route that crossed no roads, but it seemed to be following the lakeshore at
least very vaguely. I had no water, and I was really exhausted. The lactase in
my spit was forming crusts on the sides of my mouth. I had no cell phone, and
even if I had, I didn’t have any way to place myself for search & rescue
people or whever I would call. I could be out there all night, especiall if I
got a flat. 

I could die.

I had nothing to recharge my rpidly dwindling energy. I might have been able to
find food, but it was dark, and a pretty sparse Iowa ecosystem as well. My only
choice was to keep going. Backwards would kill me; I knew I was so far already.
I would gladly ask help of the next person I saw, but I saw no one. I got back
on the bike and kept pedaling. It was pretty much night. The trail started
getting more erratic, taking on those unreasonable peaks and calleys I’d
left behind earlier. A few times, I felt myself biking over rocks. I planed
through mud frequently, barely keeping the bike upright. Once I had to wade a
mud puddle. I considered ditchin the bike, but realized that was a
“mega-dumb idea”, as I said out loud; it was _helping_ me, no
matter if I did have to walk it uphill sometimes. The forest was closing in
more now. I rounded a bend and ound the trail vanishing into obscurity, or
perhaps behind some stacked sticks, in a sickly field. I began walking my bike,
occasionally sinking into an area of soft ground made by I didn’t want to
know what. But: I now could see the lake.

The trail rematerialized. I followed it along the shore; it was getting more
definite. THere were lights visible on opposite shores. W H A M. I ran into a
chain blocking the trail. I’ve always wondered what it’d be like to
hit one of those at top speed. It just stopped me, that’s all, and not
gently. I lifted the bike over the chain and found myself on paved road.

“Thank you, God,” I said. “I am not going to die in Rock
Creek State Park.” I biked along and found two guys who had stopped their
cars as they passed, and were having a conversation about hunting. They told me
where there might be potable water, but it was too dark to find it, so then
they both gave me a bottle of water and pointed me in the right direction. I
biked down the “pavement”, he called it, and found the bridge over
the lake. I couldn’t find any water at my original entry point, because
the well had vanished into the night, so I went without. Then I started up the
hill, to Grinnell.

On the way, I fixed my fender. A screw had come out, and it was flopping
around, so I replaced the screw with a twig; amazingly, it worked. The wind was
at my back now, so I made it back to Grinnell in what seemed ridiculously quick
time. Then I had a giant meal at Subway, which was mercifully still open.
I’m sure I appalled them with my absolutely filthy bare feet, one with a
previously acquired wound on it that I’d reopened on the trip. But no one
said anything. I filled up. I had an appetite for the ages. I ate every bite
and could’ve eaten more.

The rest of the night, I think I was justified in siting at the computer.
Before I did that, though I took a long, hot shower.

I need to be better at the wilderness. I need to be able to know that I
won’t die if I’m in this type of situation again. Ideally, I
won’t be. Well, at least not until I _know_ I can live.
