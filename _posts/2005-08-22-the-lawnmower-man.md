True story:

My uncle Dan and aunt Tracy recently moved. Before they did they had a neighbor
who liked to run his riding mower. All the time they would hear his mower
going. He wasn’t mowing his lawn. He actually had the mower parked there on his
patio, and he was sitting on it, letting it run. Occasionally he would have a
few beers.

This is completely irrelevant, but I remembered it a minute ago and decided I’d
write about it.
