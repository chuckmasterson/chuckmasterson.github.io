Yep, still ticking. It's late and I'm tired, so this is truly going to be just a "still alive" post. In the time since I wrote last, Misty and I have spent a week at the Possibility Alliance, a community that's at least as off-grid as the Amish (no electricity, no cars) and has refined the human aspects of permaculture like no place else I've ever been. We've also discovered that we share a favorite mode of transportation, one that isn't hitchhiking but is just as free, about which I feel it prudent not to say more at this juncture, except that if you know me, you probably know what I'm talking about.

We're heading to the National Forest soon for this year's Wild Roots Feral Futures. Hopefully I'll be able to catch you on the flip side of that. There's so much to tell and there will only be more.
