If you read the title of this post and it sounded in your mind like a clown at
the beginning of a TV show, you read it the wrong way. Imagine a slightly
frustrated teacher instead. (*Yae* means kid, *deul* (changing to
*deur* before a vowel) is the same plural I mentioned last time, and I
gather that *a *is something akin to the vocative case ending, if
you’re familiar with Latin, or if not, it’s what you use when you
call out to someone, sort of a “Hey!”.)

Sorry for not writing for a while. I decided a while back that I’d only
write during my downtime at work, which worked for a while, but then I stopped
having so much downtime, for little reasons here and there. Most recently I had
to make a plan for a week-long winter camp that’ll be held at the school
(“camp” is a euphemism for “come in to school on
vacation”), and after I made it, my co-teacher said it looked too
“old-fashioned”, and I should try to come up with “fresh,
new, and brilliant ideas”. Amanda was told to do the same, and later she
asked her co-teacher what my co-teacher might have meant by that, and what she
gathered was that my co-teacher just wants us to do everything over again
because we aren’t busy enough. 

But besides that, I was also feeling pretty well up to date with most of the
readership of this blog, as a consequence of a great Thanksgiving replete with
Skype calls. You may have heard that I made some kick-awesome Thanksgiving food
here, too. I was pretty satisfied with the way the holiday went.

Now, though, I ought to answer a question that people have been wondering
about, because I haven’t really mentioned it much. That is: what are my
students like? Now that I’ve been teaching them for most of an entire
semester, I think I can actually answer that question.

The short answer is that they’re all different. When I got here I was
sort of picturing a perfect grid of students, all looking dutifully straight
ahead, the boys with identical, unimaginative bowl cuts, the girls with hair
the same length and probably wearing dresses. Of course it’s not like
that; not even I really thought it would be, but I didn’t realize
precisely how wrong I was going to be. First off, although Koreans are racially
very homogeneous, aside from a couple commonalities like straight black hair
and eyes that are right up on the surface and remind you a little of a frog if
you’re used to the more sunken eyes of white people, the students all
look pretty different, more so than I was expecting. I’ve got some gangly
kids; some scrawny short kids; some plump kids; one kid, Gicheol, who reminds
me distinctly of a penguin; and one kid who’s wheelchair-bound.
I’ve even gotten to where I know several of their names, though not that
many. I’d know more, but the only times I hear them, they’re
embedded in Korean sentences that I can’t understand, and also, Korean
names *do* in fact all sound the same.

(I’ll digress about that for a moment. They’re formed on very rigid
rules. Each one is three syllables long; I only know of one Korean with a name
of a different length, of at least a hundred I’ve met. First comes the
family name, one syllable long. There are only about thirty family names in
Korea, and the top three most common—Lee, Park, and Kim—account for nearly half
the population. Then comes the given name, which is made of two somewhat random
syllables that are derived from old Chinese characters and combined by a sort
of mix-and-match that’s at the whims of the parents. Here are the given
names of the kids in my after-school class: Jinseon, Jiwon, Jinmin, Minuk,
Hyorin, Hyeyeong, Yun-gyeong, Dongnyeong. I long for something distinctive like
a good old “Max” or “Alicia”.)

But aside from their looks, they’re also wildly different in how they
learn, and even, it sometimes seems, *whether* they learn. In all my
classes, there are a few standouts who answer the questions most of the time.
Jiwon and Jinseon tend to dominate their respective classes, especially Jiwon
since she’s at the front. And the same way, there are some students who
just don’t get it. I’ve been amazed at the depth to which some of
them don’t get it, actually, especially considering that they’ve
been learning English since age 4, supposedly at least. Some of them have to be
coached through every single word if they’re going to read aloud, and
given half a chance they’ll furtively write down the pronunciation in
hangeul even though hangeul can only vaguely approximate a lot of sounds in
English. (“The rabbit is faster than the turtle” would become
something like “Duh rebbiteu iseu peseutuh den duh tudder.”) Even
my co-teacher, who once preached to me about not letting any kid fall behind,
has given up on the worst kid, Jaemin, who clearly doesn’t even know the
alphabet. Asked to read any word, even a simple one like “must”,
he’ll just stare at it, or (equally effectively) off into space, and if
you’re lucky he’ll make a guess like, ”
‘Can’?” He tore up his English book a few weeks ago and now
he reads comics in class.

Between those two ends of the spectrum, there are kids with every level of
ability in between. Most of them seem to be most comfortable when we do listen
and repeat exercises, which are probably the most prominent thing in the
classes. Which is discouraging, because it’s not an effective way for the
kids to learn anything but pronunciation, and maybe not even that, since I
can’t tell if all 27 kids who are chorusing out “Jinho thought
about asking Santa for the presents” pronounces each word correctly, or
even at all. The much more effective way for them to learn would be for them to
talk to each other in English in pairs or in small groups. But whenever we do
anything like that, such as pair games, at least 80% of what I hear spoken is
Korean, verging up to 100% depending on the kind of game or activity. English
comes out of their mouths only with a great effort of extraction, is what
I’m saying.

That about describes them academically. But they also have personalities, lots
of them. I don’t know everything about this matter, since I can’t
understand most of what they say to each other, but I get the gist. My
after-school class, eight kids, is especially good for observing this.

The girls are very cliquey. Typically they all come in at the same time, since
they were just hanging out outside or downstairs together, and all five of them
sit at the same four-person table. Unless I’m doing something unusually
fascinating, which I have to keep on my toes and try to do every class, they
mostly lean in close and gossip among themselves. I have no idea what stories
they’re telling, but I imagine fashion and love are heavily involved.
Maybe next time I’ll ask them if they can say it in English, though
they’ll probably just say, “I don’t know, teacher.”
Sometimes, when the discussion gets heated enough, they whack each other with
stuff, or chase each other around the room. Jiwon and Yun-gyeong seem to be
especially good gossipers, but the other three, Hyeyeong, Jinmin, and Hyorin,
seem to be pretty well involved too. Jiwon is definitely the loudest. If I
split the class up into teams, the girls will insist on being their own team
even if the numbers are uneven; I’ve had them ask for a girls’ team
even when all five of them were there and the boys were represented by just
poor Minuk.

The boys are more loners. They come in one at a time. Jinseon shows up ten
minutes before class, Minuk comes in ten minutes after it starts (as do most of
the girls), and Dongnyeong shows up at random times every few days (when he
doesn’t have Japanese lessons, I think). They sit together, but
it’d be kind of ridiculous not to, since there are just three of them and
the desks are in clusters of four. They also don’t talk much until I call
on them, which is nice. However, they’re usually the ones responsible for
getting on the computer and opening up webpages about knives or video games or
K-Pop. Jinseon is bookish and in the minutes before class he sits and reads
about something or other. Dongnyeong likes to call people stupid and probably
makes lots of fart jokes when I’m not around. Minuk is quiet in English
class and I get the impression that he’s probably quiet all the time. It
seems like they’re a more diverse bunch than the girls, although I could
be totally stereotyping just because I can’t understand them. But
they’re definitely different from the girls, I can tell that for a fact.
In Korea the men are meant to act manly and the women are meant to act womanly,
and I can see it starting in this bunch. (That’s not to say anything of
their looks; Korean men are pretty androgynous and fashionable, as I mentioned
last time.)

They’re mostly fun people to be around, very energetic and apparently
getting a kick out of lots of things, but occasionally they’re
disappointing. I decided I was going to start a big thing with the after-school
kids, since I don’t have to follow any particular curriculum for them. I
started writing a story. I decided to base it off of Daniel Pinkwater’s
*The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death*—I can’t decide whether
this or Pinkwater’s other book *Alan Mendelsohn, the Boy from Mars*
is the best children’s book ever. I wrote the beginning in simple English
and brought it in to class to have them read it and decide what the next plot
development in the story would be. In this story the protagonist, a Korean kid,
has to move to Chicago, but finds some friends there. At the end of the first
installment, the characters have just strolled by a movie theater that
advertises that it’s open 24 hours and tickets are $2. One of the
protagonist’s friends says they should come watch a movie in the middle
of the night, because that’d be a great adventure. All the other
characters say that sounds pretty cool. Will Jeonghyeon come to the movie? The
kids voted no. Why? “I must do my homework.” Or, “I must
sleep.” Apparently there’s no such thing as a sense of adventure in
Korea. I’ve since had to scrap the story because they weren’t
paying any attention to it. Maybe it was my writing or my pacing, but I think
they just have a total lack of curiosity about anything that’s a little
strange or offbeat. It’s popular culture, love, and video games for them.
All the rest is for deviants.

But they’re still all great to me. In some of my bigger classes
it’s hard to keep them on task, but even when my co-teacher’s not
around, I still manage to get most of them to do what they’re supposed to
be doing. They’re polite to me and they generally listen when I tell them
to stop tearing around the room hitting each other. And they even sing the
stupid songs that the textbook’s companion CD foists on them. Maybe they
won’t all speak English fluently, but for the most part they’re
trying. So I suppose I could have it worse.
