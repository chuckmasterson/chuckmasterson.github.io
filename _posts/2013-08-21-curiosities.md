I’m in Missoula, Montana, right now, but before I write about the weird
time I’ve had so far here (it’s looking up) or my very nebulous
plans for the near future, I’m going to say I learned my lesson about
blogging about a place prematurely when I gave Calgary a “meh” and
then discovered cooler things about it, and so instead of Missoula, I’m
just going to write about some odd things I’ve noticed.


First off, there is such a thing as the United States Boomerang Association.
They have a newsletter. The newsletter is called *Many Happy Returns*.


Last time I was in Cincinnati, I was listening to some music from Mongolian
band Altan Urag. One of their songs it called “Duujin Daajin”,
which, when I was in Mongolia, the Grinnellian I was visiting explained to me
means “seesaw”. While I was listening to that song, it struck me
that both English and Mongolian have a word for seesaw that’s obviously
inspired by the back-and-forth seesawing motion. In fact, English even has
*two*, because we also call it a teeter-totter. And so I logically figured that
a lot of languages might have words like that for a seesaw. But when I did the
translation work, I was disappointed. These were the only ones I found:

* English: see-saw, teeter-totter
* Mongolian: duujin-daajin
* Chinese: 蹺蹺板 (qiāoqiāobǎn)
* Tagalog: lawin-lawinan
* Hebrew: נדנדה (nadinedah)

There were also a few languages that borrowed the English word, like Korean and
Japanese, which both interpreted it as *shiso*. But that doesn’t really
count for what I’m looking for. Then it occurred to me that
*zigzag* might also be a good word to check out. The results were even
more disappointing:

* English: zigzag
* Chinese: 蜿蜒 (wān yán)—also notice that the characters have the same
  left radical
* Welsh: igam-ogam

A whole lot of languages have words that look like the English word, though
it’s hard to say which of them borrowed it from us, and which borrowed it
from the German *Zickzack*, which is where we got it originally anyhow. Basque
has *sigi-saga*; Hebrew has סִכסָך (sikhsakh); Russian and Ukrainian have
*зигзаг* (zigzag); Serbian has *цик-цак* (tsik-tsak); Korean has 지그재그
(jigeujageu); Japanese has ジグザグ (jigujagu)—though they also
have うねうね (une-une), which doesn’t exactly mean *zigzag*, as far
as I can tell through an [image
search][zz],
but rather something like *zebra-striped* or *psychedelic* or
*trippy*. An unimpressive lack of originality on the part of the world’s
languages, English included. Only the Germans, the Chinese, the Welsh, and
maybe the Japanese show any initiative.

I swear there was one more curiosity, but I can’t remember it right
now. If I do, I’ll update this. Even though two curiosities is a pretty
lame list, I’ll leave it at that for now because I’m in a library
and I won’t be able to think of it without going out for a walk around or
something.
