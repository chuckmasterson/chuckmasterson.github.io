Someone once said that every writer has a thousand lousy stories in them, and
you have to just write them and get them out of the way to get to the good
ones. I figured I’d better get started.

You probably noticed I haven’t posted for a while, and I really should be
writing some stuff, just sort of general thoughts on the end of the year and my
thoughts about the whole Korea experience. Well, that’ll come next, but first I
wanted to finish this story and put it up here so anyone can see it. [So here
it is.](/assets/pdf/MainLine.pdf)

Before you start, I’ll mention a few things about it. It’s not the frog story
that I kept mentioning a while ago; it’s a different one.  It’s 25 pages long
(these are roughly equivalent to fairly large-print paperback pages) and, since
you may not be expecting this from me, there’s also copious profanity, mainly
because most of the characters in it are just that kind of people. Also, if you
know what’s been going on in Micah’s life, it’ll probably become obvious that I
drew pretty heavily on his story. But it’s only inspired by a few real events
here and there; it isn’t actually a faithful retelling of anything.

So that’s it. Maybe it’s good, maybe it’s not. In any case, it has a beginning,
a middle, and an end, so it’s a story.

(Oh, by the way—it’s set in that font I’ve been working on.)
