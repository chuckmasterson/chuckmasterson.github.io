I promised to write some full-length blogs in England, didn’t I? But then
I wrote one about Italy and I guess I thought, “Enh, that’ll do.
I’m going to see everyone in person in a couple weeks anyhow. And
I’ll have unlimited internet when I’m at home and nothing
interesting that I’ll feel like I’m missing.” But I owe you
at least a quick update.

I’m in Oxford now; Sean thought Dave’s advice of going to see it
sounded reasonably good, and it seemed like a nice place to me too. I just got
in a couple hours ago, so the only thing I’ve done so far is walk along
High Street (in the rain). Apparently a famous architectural historian called
Oxford’s High Street “one of the world’s great streets”
(this is from a plaque they put up along it), and it is pretty nice. About half
the buildings are old and stone, and the other half are nice little restaurants
or pubs or expensive-goods shops. I would’ve enjoyed it a bit more if
they’d turned off the rain, though. I’m CouchSurfing again here,
still getting to know my host, Judit from Germany. She’s out for
groceries at the moment, so I can’t tell you what her studies here are
in, but I know at least one thing she studies is Arabic.

I had a great time in the Southampton area with Sean as my guide and chauffeur.
I owe him big next time he comes to America and I have a stable abode. The New
Forest is around there, and I guess it’s fairly new compared to
old-growth forests, but compared to a human or to a lot of the scrubby woods
around the States, it’s ancient. It’s full of horses strolling
around wild, the “New Forest ponies” (they’re full-size
horses, they just call them ponies). Quite possibly as a result, the forest is
made of giant, wizardy-looking old trees without much growing between them.
They’re all covered in moss, both the living and the dead ones. One day I
climbed up dozens of feet in the air in a particularly amazing tree. All around
me I could see the deep green of the forest -- that’s the moss,
because all the leaves are on the ground at this time of year. It was humid and
dark and I felt as though the trees could easily start walking at any point, to
attack Isengard.

After this sojourn in Oxford, I’m headed to Wales, then back to Sean so
we can go to Stonehenge for Yuletide (winter solstice), and then all
that’s left is a couple more days in London. I already had two there, but
I still haven’t seen the Changing of the Guards at Buckingham Palace, or
Evensong at Westminster Abbey, or a bunch of other cool stuff. London is big,
walking is slow, and the Tube is bloody expensive. Getting around to everything
is tough. But I’ll get to things.
