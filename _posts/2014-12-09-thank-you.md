Thank you for the childhood summers that made me who I am, Papaw. Thank you for
bringing all of us kids to your forest, for creating the magical, bright green
months of throwing rocks and twigs in the creek and creating our moss-floored
clubhouses, the summers that even now in my memories seem too good to have
really happened, the home that’s still imprinted on my best dreams a
decade and more later. You taught me what it means to know the land; you made
me get out there and climb the trees and run up and down the hill and get
dirty. You were the rock. You were 82 years old, but I’ll live to be one
with the hills the way you showed me, and you’ll live on in all us
cousins. Thank you for everything, Papaw.
