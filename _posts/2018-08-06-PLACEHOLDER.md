It’s summertime! Don’t you just feel like going outside, exploring, spending time with friends, jumping into lakes?

Well I do, apparently to the exclusion of writing about any of it here. In years past I had a desk job for which I would get up every morning, even during the summer, and sit at a computer tip-tapping away at a keyboard. My back faced a window. Every once in a while I had to turn around and look outside. There was nothing but a busy industrial road, a stone retaining wall, and a few trees planted there almost grudgingly, it seemed. And sunlight, and the sky: and during coffee breaks or after lunch I would sometimes walk outside to see these. The spacefaring frontier outlaws of *Firefly* are represented by a song that goes:

<section class="poetry" markdown="1">
> Take my [     ], take my land, put me where I cannot stand  
> [      ], [        ], you can’t take the sky from me  
> You can’t take the sky from me.

</section>

I remembered them when I looked out at the clouds, some of my few anchors to reality out there in the concrete wastes. But even with their help, I still sank into a sort of stupefaction in which a day howsoever beautiful was nearly powerless to lead me outside. I was in the city. Where’s the outside? Yes, there’s outside there. But for me, trying to spend quality time with it was an exercise in tantalism. Now that I’ve divorced myself from the city I find myself interested more in romping and much less in planting myself in front of a screen. (Though I should make sure to disclose that I have a good old self-defeating pattern in which I *want* to do some writing, but I don’t want to be at a screen to do it, or even sit still or exert effort, but the sense of obligation lingers, so instead I sit at the computer and feel so demoralized that instead of buckling down and being creative I just do mostly-pointless research and look at funny pictures, and so I end up spending probably a lot more screen time than I would if I just plowed through the discomfort and wrote. Here I am now, enjoying writing. It only took half a week of dinking around to get here.)

In any case, now where’d I leave off?

### Bemidji

In Bemidji there’s a coffee shop with two computers free for anyone to use. That’s where I posted my [haiku](/blog/2018/06/02/still-alive-bemidji) from. It’s also where I wasted the next day good and proper, checked out of the world, absorbed into the computers and a copy of *Huck Finn* I’d bought a few towns back, afer starting the day with good intentions of exploring what I’d heard was a nice little town, because it was Sunday and nothing was open and I forgot how to be creative and meet people if not at a bookstore or a library. It’s fine to have a rest day sometimes. But this wasn’t that. I felt adrift, uncomfortably ghostlike. I allowed my mind very little peace, only distractions. I spent the day wrong.

The next day I planned to ride on northward, but as I struck camp I stopped short. I had shortchanged Bemidji, I realized, and myself. I couldn’t go on yet.

So I rode back around Lake Bemidji (*Bemijigamaag*: Where the Waters Cross) to a bait shop I’d noticed, where I got some leeches and some advice, the latter leading me to the little fishing pier right there downtown, where the young Mississippi River enters the lake for a short visit before carrying on toward the Twin Cities, the Quad Cities, St Louis, Memphis, and the Gulf of Mexico. Here a kid could skip a stone across it, and I’m sure many do. You’d never know that it picks up enough help later on to swell to three miles across. The pier is a couple dozen yards downstream from one of the first highway bridges on the river, lightly graffitied. It seemed somehow that in the first city on the Mississippi, the first bridge should have more of a legendary quality. Aside from some basically tasteful pillars faced in local round granite rocks, it could’ve been a bridge anywhere, over any anonymous Minnesota stream.

When I arrived there was just one guy fishing, who told me he didn’t plan to really catch anything, since the walleye don’t start biting until evening. After a while he was joined by an eleven-year-old kid named Lakota flush with school’s-just-out elation, who planned to come down and fish every day of summer vacation, and was excited to teach me everything he knew about fishing. I was grateful for the help, since practically all the fishing I’d ever done so far had been in Crowduck Lake from a boat, and I hadn’t the foggiest idea how to fish from land in Minnesota. I was even grateful when he taught me things I already knew. The kid had initiative. I caught a five-inch perch, and counted the day successful. Anything else would just be gravy.

I wandered around aimlessly and came back in the evening. Now a crowd had arrived, Lakota plus another eight or so guys casting off of every available railing of the pier. I posted up at an unlikely spot and proceeded to happily catch nothing. Eventually someone left a good spot and I took it. After a long time I caught a walleye. I talked with the guys and stopped feeling alone. The guy next to me was Turtle Mountain Ojibwe and lived near the Red Lake Reservation to the north, and told me about it a little. The kids he was with were goofy and distractable. Lakota borrowed leeches from me. I enjoyed my night.

### Red Lake

I pressed on the next day, now with a clear conscience, up due north to Red Lake and then east. While I was northbound and had a tailwind I was enjoying everything; had a lot of peace and goodwill, and maybe even some moments of full mindfulness of the world, sky suddenly a much deeper blue once I stopped humming the song stuck in my head, trees alive in a way they weren’t before. In Ojibwe the word for “listen”, *bizindan*, is full of the word for “quietly”, *bizaan*. I quieted myself down so I could listen. *Bizaan-ayaan.* A woman at the coffee shop had warned me away from Red Lake. “I have a lot of friends there and I can tell you, they don’t appreciate white people coming through and just treating it like it’s their land.” Well, I offered tobacco as I came in and made sure to keep a deferential spirit, whether or not anyone could tell from in their cars. I can’t say if everyone was happy to see me rolling down the potholes and hills of Minnesota 1 along the southern shore of Red Lake, but it was on the rez, and only on the rez, that two people stopped their cars to have a chat with me about what I was up to. Both had passengers who got into it too, and it was smiles all around. The first was a lady who’d seen me in the morning outside Bemidji. “How’d you get here so fast?” The second just curious where I was going while I was stopped to read a sign (<span class="small-caps">Endazhi-ganawendamang Nibi</span>, “Where We Care for Water”) at the turnoff for the peninsula town of Ponemah, strongest bastion of the Ojibwe language in the States, where I wouldn’t be going just now. 

On the reservation I saw hand-stenciled signs for tribal election candidates, signs to encourage people not to do drugs, signs about the bygone ogimaaban who decreed the rez should be dry, a tribal college and government center sheltering under two giant eagles sculpted onto their roofs. But even where there weren’t signs I felt like I was *somewhere*, somewhere cared for. When I crossed the boundary back into Anglo Country, I felt suddenly betrayed; it was fields and tractors and pillaging, and I realized I hadn’t seen any of that for twenty miles. Hi, cattle. I was in land left behind,[^1] forfeit, no one’s using this so I’ll go ahead and ugly it up with a lot of mowing and machining.

[^1]: Interesting, too, that Anglo Country should feel that way to me, since the Ojibwe word for “reservation”, *ishkonigan*, literally means “left over” or “put aside”.

### Northome

The miles to Northome were long, stretched by a headwind, but at six-thirty I made it, though now full of yawns. A sixteen-year-old working at the gas station gave me directions to a campground by a little lake, where the sunset was a world of glowing, a Reminder. A crane flew across it and landed ten feet from my tent. A flight of geese threaded across the sky and disappeared. The kid from the station brought down a water bottle I’d forgotten there and I asked him how he liked this place. “I love it. I’ll be here my whole life,” he said.

When the last of the sun went below the horizon and left only its dim echoes of light bouncing off the thin sky, a switch was flipped somewhere and trapdoors opened, releasing a dense black cloud of mosquitoes, pent up all day and itching for blood. One minute I was sitting transfixed by the sunset, and the next I was diving for cover into my tent. I had the door unzipped for all of seven seconds and still had to spend the next hour swatting all the mosquitoes that had followed me in. The rest struck up a frustrated whine from where they blanketed the tent wall, and had I not staked the tent down they may have carried it away.

Just after I entered Red Cliff an old guy had talked with me a little at the gas station where I’d stopped for a breather. He mentioned that rain was expected. Hard to believe from that sunset, but I put up the rain fly anyhow. Well, if I ever learned anything true from a Native American elder, that was it. It rained and the wind came ripping through. The tent developed an alarming lean. Water seeped in. But for the most part, I stayed dry.

### International Falls and Fort Frances

US Route 71 runs straight northeast from Northome to International Falls through bright green low country, lined with little yellow and white flowers. I sometimes went ten minutes without seeing a car. All alongside me were bogs, popple forests, regrowing clearcuts. Next to the highway there ran a little drainage, which I discovered beavers had dammed---so I went high-stepping down into the grass for a look. The water was such a clear brown---I hadn’t realized it could be both at once. Everything so alive. I was amazed how deep the matted grass from previous years went. I felt like a cat in a room full of pillows. Later I stopped at a big stack of logs and climbed up it. I stopped here and three all day, letting my curiosity direct. Biking is good for views but to actually get to know a place I still have to dismount and go walk and touch things. My body requires variety.

After Pelland, things took a turn for the worse. Lawns! Everywhere! They were massive, sprawling, unconscionable! Where did my woods go Where are the red-winged blackbirds? Then the big box stores set in, and then the concrete, and here we are in International Falls. I ate, found a camping spot in a vacant lot I’d used the previous year, and slept, trying not to let it get to me too badly.

The next day I stashed my stuff in some brush and biked to the border. I only had one goal for the day: get some Canadian postcards. When I found them at an all-and-sundry store they were at least ’70s vintage, the kind of postcards old enough that the printing company touted its ability to print in color. But having thus achieved what I set out for, I felt reluctant to leave the country. Fort Frances has narrow streets with pedestrians milling about, lined with old-fashioned storefronts. It bustles, in its modest way; it looks lived-in. International Falls offered a drab gray prospect. I found a coffee shop in Fort Frances. I stopped drinking coffee earlier this trip, on the Pine River (which is a place that’s a story all its own, which I haven’t told yet), but I still find myself drawn to coffee shops. There’s always tea. I ordered a London fog and the proprietor, a caffeine-powered individual named Ben, gave me the scoop on Ontarian and Canadian politics ahead of the upcoming election, and I wrote postcards.

### The CN to Duluth

In the evening it was time to check out the switchyard.

I had decided to save a little time on the return trip southbound by, if I could, catching a freight from I-Falls to Duluth. In fact I prepared for this possibility before I even left Minneapolis. Part of my gear was an old hiking backpack frame, across which I had strung a couple cables. The cables were for hanging my bike panniers; then I’d tie everything else on, and bungee the whole mess together, giving me a way to carry everything on my back and then heave it onto a train car in one go (and then the bike in a second go), rather than fiddling with clips and bungees and tossing bags on individually while the train airs up and leaves without me. The International Falls switchyard is actually a few miles east of town in Ranier. I crossed over the tracks on an under-construction bridge and then rolled the bike back through a dormant ground-level construction site, along the highway, through boglike squish, until I got to a spot on the tracks right by the overpass.

There were three tracks, and each one had a train on it. Trouble was, I couldn’t see the headend of any of them, even standing on the overpass---to the north the tracks went around a bend, and to the south the trains stretched so far I couldn’t make anything out at the far ends. So I would have to let all three of these leave, and wait until a train I would positively know to be southbound on account of it coming in pointed south. In some circumstances I might’ve taken a chance or gone scouting, but today I didn’t really feel like explaining my travel plans to the border patrol.

Around 9:00 a southbound came in, an intermodal,[^im] and pulled to a stop. Time to strike. I carried the bike over my train and walked along between mine and the next train over, putting my target train between me and the bull run,[^br] searching out a car I could hide on. I got all the way to the end of the train with only semi-bad prospects, and turned around toward the headend. After a while I settled for an okayish car with a very shallow mini-well.[^mw]

![picture](/apicture)

I lay the bike flat on one side, and my stuff and me flat on the other side (sleeping pad under me to keep something between me and the cold steel), and waited.

It was a weird train. Around 10:00 it started moving, but not very far. The sky darkened, the stars came out. It moved again, this time into the first floodlights of the yard. From that point on it would move forward a hundred yards or so, then stop dead for ten or twenty minutes, then repeat the drill. Meanwhile, I got treated to a tour of lots of different floodlit spots along the course of the switchyard. Sometimes I would dare to crane my neck up for a few seconds to see where I was. Still next to the bull run, was the answer, still in the lights. No one seemed to be paying much attention to my train, but one small slip-up can ruin a trip and a day very effectively, and I stayed hunkered down, in a constant heart-pounding fight-or-flight state. Yard workers walked around just one track away, blocked from seeing me only by a train that they could climb over anytime. The train moved forward again. An engine was on the next track over, only two or three carlengths back, and its various mechanisms powered up and down automatically but nervewrackingly, continually making me wonder if a conductor was getting on board. I lay very flat. Sleep was out of the question. The train moved forward; more floodlights. This yard was endless. Every time I figured we were finally pulling out onto the road I landed in more floodlights. 

[^im]: Train carrying shipping containers.
[^br]: The gravel road along the tracks that railcops (“bulls”) and crew transport cars use.
[^mw]: A little depression, outside the main load area, that’s part of the design of some intermodal cars---as contrasted to a regular well (much roomier), the space left over between the end of a shipping container and the wall of the well it’s put into, on intermodal cars that have a floor.

Just to give the whole thing a good climax, when my train finally did get moving, so did another train right next to it, and I had to jump out of my sleeping bag in my long johns and hang onto the far side of my car’s shipping container to keep out of view of the other train’s conductor, butt sticking out onto the bull run where I prayed a car wouldn’t appear, while the two trains jockeyed back and forth a time or two. Mine came out ahead and the other one stayed in the yard, as I deduced when we got onto singletrack, where I could finally breathe and my heart could calm down.

For a while I couldn’t sleep because I was too excited. Eventually I settled down and consoled myself with the knowledge that I could watch the woods go by in the day too. But by 5:00 or so I was up again, packing up my stuff to a less visible configuration while the train crept by a siding, which luckily turned out not to have a passing train on it, and, woken up but good, I hung out the rest of the morning watching and marveling. Pristine, all of it! Most train tracks have had a highway built alongside them, crammed with buttinski motorists who would love to report any unapproved thrill-seeking to the authorities, and you have to keep hidden for most of your ride. These tracks, at least starting from where I woke up (near Cook or Orr), barely get near a highway. What they do go near is peaceful tannin-brown creeks through lush bogs, thick bristling northland forests, and the occasional little town like Melrude or Shaw where there has never been a paved road. This was a rare ride. I paid close attention to appreciating it: the mist rising off a river rarely seen by any humans besides train conductors; a bog at dawn, chilly and like it was just thought into existence. I got deeply and viscerally cold in the humid dawn chill, but I didn’t mind; I just jumped up and down like a lunatic to keep the blood flowing, and smiled maniacally.

As the sun was starting to clear the treetops, the train stopped, for the first time since it’d left, under a highway bridge. I’d seen enough clues to figure I was close to Duluth. And I made a snap decision: since I had a bicycle, I would skip the whole fun drama of pulling into the yard while staying out of sight, then dodging around over and between strings[^st] to find a low-profile way out to the world. I could just ride into town. The beauty of the combination of bike and train impressed itself on me. This is something I could get used to.

### Southerly

I rode through Hermantown first, a disgusting sprawl of non-place, and then plummeted (breaking the speed limit) into Duluth, which was a tangled confusion and a bigger city than I’d been in for a month. It freaked me out, but it wasn’t too long before I got safely out the other side of it onto the Willard Munger Trail, a bike path artfully punched through Canadian Shield granite and draped across the crashing of the St Louis River’s waterfall. In the early evening I found a clearing off the side of the trail, set up my tent, and before the sun was down I was.

The Munger Trail took me as far as Hinckley and then left me to get to ARC of my own devices. I brought Misty one of Tobie’s world-famous cinnamon rolls, a Hinckley compulsory, and we talked about ARC’s mass exodus. Seems while I was gone, everyone living there decided that, for one reason or another, they had to leave. Only one person would be left (Medora, the one I gave the [fern tattoo][fern] to). Misty, for their part, was heading to the Cities to do exterior house painting.
