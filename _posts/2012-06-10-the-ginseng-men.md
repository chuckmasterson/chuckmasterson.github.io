One day last week I took a walk to get out of the house after staying inside
all morning. I went down a different road than usual and found myself in a part
of town that I’d never seen before. It was unfamiliar, strange; I want to
say foreign, but of course I’m living in a foreign country, so I could
call everything that. It’s just that I’ve gotten used to Korea, but
this seemed unlike what I’d gotten used to—doubly foreign. It
wasn’t actually that drastically different. The streets were narrower,
and the houses were closer to them. One house had flowers growing inside the
concrete barrier between it and the street. There were some tiny cinder-block
stores with no English on the signs out front. I walked up a hill and passed a
mushroom farm—a series of greenhouses each with a few cables strung from one
end to the other and, leaning on the cables, logs with holes drilled in them
and inoculated with spores. Across from it was a very old man walking out of a
blue tin building, and hand farm equipment that looked generations old was
lying around. At a crest in the hill I looked out and I could see the rice
paddy that’s down the hill from where I live, which I’ve never
really seen before because it’s obscured by buildings—this paddy is where
the multitudes of frogs live that I hear chorusing in high voices every night
through my window.

I suddenly felt a deep sense of the profoundness of this place, simultaneous
with a realization that I was only connected to it in the very shallowest of
ways, not even knowing well a single person who lives here. I’ve come to
this town and lived on the very surface, interacting with the people here
barely any more than absolutely necessary to let me buy groceries to survive.
But people have been living here and doing things for longer than I have any
idea of, maybe only for a few decades, but maybe for centuries. There’s a
war memorial just outside town on the road to Chuncheon that’s dedicated
to the soldiers who retook this place from the Chinese army in 1951. However
old this particular town is, there have been people living near here since time
immemorial, surely back through all the dynasties that warred for power over
the Korean peninsula starting when there was no writing to record the victories
and losses. With something akin to a panic, borne of the knowledge that I have
less than three months left here, I decided I needed to hurry and start
understanding more about this place than just the places where it’s
possible to find food. It felt like if I didn’t do that, I would look
back later and think I’d wasted a whole year that was made entirely of
the opportunity to learn, but if I did, all the stuff I’d observed over
the course of the year would finally solidify into actual knowledge.

Ways to fulfill my resolution started materializing with an almost magical
speed. This Friday, I went out jogging with Sean to the disused bridge over the
Jichon Stream that we tend to go to. It’s right next to a bridge
that’s in use; I’m guessing that it was deemed unsafe and replaced,
but then never torn down. When we got there, there were a few trucks parked on
it and a tent set up among them. A middle-aged guy was hanging clothes in the
dilapidated gazebo that stands at one end of the bridge, next to the modern
road that we’d just arrived on. I jumped over the guardrail and said
hello, and asked if he was camping (which was a bit of a stupid question
because, well, _obviously_, but my command of Korean wasn’t up to asking
more intelligent questions). Through much repetition and simplification, he
eventually managed to explain to me that he and his friends were a group of
guys who climb mountains to hunt for wild ginseng. It’s a highly prized
medicine, much more esteemed than the farmed kind, and can sell for a lot of
money. I immediately asked if I could come along. He told me to come back at 8
in the morning, and they’d be going up soon after. So I commenced getting
excited, and said goodbye, and Sean and I jogged back home.

I showed up bright and early the next morning. Before I even got to the ginseng
men, I came to a couple guys in a little blue flatbed truck, the kind that you
see everywhere here. The guys were in beekeeping suits and after I noticed that
I realized that the wooden boxes in the back of their truck were hives, with
bees flying in and out. I watched them lay a white tray on top of a few white
honeycombs on the ground by the wildflowers and weeds that grow along the old
length of road that leads to the old bridge. I didn’t manage to strike up
a conversation with them, but it was pretty clear what they were doing, anyhow.
After they laid the tray down, they drove off.

The ginseng men were unpacking various stuff from their trucks to make
breakfast. There were some mats laid on the concrete, and a giant, dented old
pot boiling over a gas burner. We all sat down on the mats and someone brought
out a pot of rice, and the giant pot was brought over. It turned out to be full
of broth made of chicken and _deodeok_ (a root that they might have found
in the forest or might have bought in a store, I’m not sure). We talked,
though mostly they talked and I didn’t quite understand what was going
on. Then breakfast finished and everyone started getting ready to climb the
mountain. Only, I discovered then that they hadn’t actually invited me to
go hunting ginseng with them, they’d only invited me for breakfast. They
told me that I needed boots and long pants, because there are snakes on the
mountain. This smelled like an excuse to me, but I didn’t press the
issue, because when I stepped back to consider it, this was an obviously pretty
tight-knit group of guys who were having a good time together and also knew
what they were doing, and I was some foreign yutz who barely understood them
and had invited himself along. They all suited up in long pants and boots, but
they did tell me that I should come back at five and we’d have dinner. I
was disappointed, but I understood, so I biked off back home.

To assuage the disappointment a little, I went and climbed Chang’an
Mountain with Sean—the same mountain we always climb, but this time we climbed
it from a different direction. At five I biked down to the bridge again and met
the ginseng men. “Good luck?” I asked them. “No,” they
said. They’d only found four ginseng plants. One of the guys showed me
the plants, kept tenderly in a plastic bag for the time being. They’d
explained to me before that the older the plant, the more it sells for.
It’s possible to find plants that are as much as a hundred years old,
though these are of course quite rare, the find of a lifetime. Such a plant
could sell for ten million won ($8500). These, he told me, were nowhere near
that league; they were mostly five or six years old. I didn’t catch the
price he expected to get for them.

We settled down and they brought out the burners to start getting dinner ready.
The menu tonight was chicken cooked _baeksuk_ style—just a plain
chicken dunked in a lot of water and boiled for a long time with a few roots
and wood chips. I’m not sure if they even used the roots and wood chips.
While that was boiling, we had some _banchan_ (side dishes) and some
pork-kimchi stir-fry. It wasn’t gourmet fare, but it was pretty well
suited to the occasion: a bunch of mountain men camping out in one of the most
middle-of-nowhere parts of Korea.

In addition to all this, there was of course a profusion of liquor. They gave
it to me liberally and before long I was pretty well smashed. This happens when
you eat dinner with Koreans, especially men—pretty much every time. We talked a
lot, but regrettably, the thing where you can talk in a foreign language more
fluently when you’re drunk doesn’t work on me, at least not with
Korean—I have yet to try it with any other languages. We did manage to sustain
a few conversations about America, and how I liked Korea. They also told me
that another reason they didn’t invite me up the mountain was because I
haven’t had training, and I’m not old enough. I don’t see
where age has anything to do with it, (it’s probably the traditional
Korean hierarchical system shining through), but it was true that I
didn’t really know what to look for, and I’d probably be telling
them all to come over and check out some weeds that I was convinced were a
jackpot. Or more likely just wasting their time by needing lots of
explanations. At some point, the guy sitting next to me, Cha U-jin, invited me
to have dinner with him where he lives in Seoul next time I go there, and gave
me his business card (it was for his mountain ginseng business, but it seems he
also does some exporting of various items). And we had a merry old time. We all
ate and ate, and talked and laughed and enjoyed being out under the stars next
to a mountain where they’d just found a bounty, albeit small. It
felt like longer, but when I staggered over to my bike to go home, it turned
out to be only about ten o’clock. I managed to bike home and then
collapsed.

The next day (today), they were off at a different mountain some thirty
minutes’ drive distant, but they told me before I left the first dinner
that I should come back and bring them some of the American food that I was
planning on making for dinner. There’s really only one American food that
I make anymore, and that’s 5-ways. My bi-weekly 5-way is sort of precious
to me, but they had given me tons of food last night, and even if it
weren’t for wanting to repay them, there was also the fact that I was
pretty well stuffed and probably had no business eating an entire 5-way. So I
compartmentalized the ingredients and brought them over to the bridge.

At five o’clock they were still cleaning stuff and putting stuff away
from the day’s hike. This included themselves—one guy was down under the
bridge right next to ours, bathing himself in the Jichon Stream, naked and
unconcerned. One of the other guys on the bridge warned him that someone was
liable to take a picture of him. They were sort of talking among themselves,
probably about logistics and boring stuff, so I stood around and watched things
happening. Cranes were flying overhead—they’ve gotten to be plentiful
around here. One crane was standing in the stream.

While I took a picture of it, some people came wading up the stream behind it,
toward the bridge, one of them carrying a bucket. I went down to ask them what
they were gathering, and they told me, “Meat.” If I recall right,
there was a woman in her thirties or so, an any-man, and a shriveled,
white-haired, but very nimble old guy. Two of them were carrying heavy metal
spud bars, for reasons I couldn’t fathom. They brought their bucket up
and I discovered that “meat” meant fish, lots of little ones about
four inches long. (Later I figured that maybe the spud bars were poles they had
used to secure fish traps.) The Korean word for fish is _mulgogi_, and
I’d always wondered if it was just a coincidence that it’s the same
as if you joined the words _mul_ (water) and _gogi_ (meat). I guess
it’s not. The ginseng men gathered around to look at the fish and then
wished them a tasty meal.

It was raining a little today, so we had dinner in the old gazebo instead of on
the bridge. While the more time-consuming dinners were cooking, I assembled the
5-way in a pot they got out, and we ate it with chopsticks.

The temperature was all wrong because it had had too much time to cool down,
but we still all ate it with gusto and they asked why I hadn’t brought
more. A couple of them took to eating it with kimchi, and convinced me to try
the same. (It was not good.) We drank a little, but they were aware that I had
to work tomorrow in the morning, so they didn’t give me a lot. They
didn’t drink much either, but they didn’t have to worry about being
in an office; it was around this time that I thought to ask how often they do
this, and the round-faced guy who’d taken a shine to me told me that this
is every day for them, at least during the season, which runs from May to
October. Here I’d been thinking that they were just a group of old army
friends who liked to take a yearly vacation together, looking for mountain
ginseng and drinking. It seemed like it couldn’t be lucrative enough for
them to break even, so I asked again about the rewards they could expect to
reap. They had a twelve-year-old plant out so I could take a picture of it, and
they told me they could expect to sell it for about 700,000 won, or $600. That
was way more than I’d been thinking. It got me to considering that I
should probably keep an eye out for mountain ginseng too when I’m out
walking. Not that I’m likely to find any, if a party of six men who do
this for a living (or at least part of a living) can come down from eight hours
of searching with only four plants. But all the same, it’s something to
keep an eye out for.

For the rest of dinner we had Korean-style chicken noodle soup, and we talked a
bit, but it seemed like we’d exhausted the number of things I could talk
about with my limited vocabulary, and we ended up repeating stuff we’d
already talked about. One of the guys, who I guess was drinking a lot more than
I noticed, started talking about how much sex he was having when he was about
my age. (The rest of them smiled stoically and bore it.) Dinner tapered off and
everyone got up. I took a few pictures and then called it a night, and promised
to come see them if they were ever around here again. Tomorrow they’re
driving to mountains in other parts. But it’s okay, because I have a date
to make cucumber and radish kimchis with the the women from downstairs
tomorrow. The country is starting to reveal itself to me, finally.
