I fell asleep on the bus and woke up miscellaneously through the night, but
mainly in Chiang Mai at the beginning of the next day, feeling unexpectedly
well rested. I jumped into a tuk-tuk—for the first time—and told the driver to
take me to the city center, wherever that might be. He dropped me off right
next to the Thapae gate. I had to discover that name by looking it up in the
map, because I wasn’t aware that Chiang Mai had such a thing as gates.
Here was one, though, allowing passage through an orange brick wall twenty feet
high and nearly as thick, topped with battlements and guard posts that must
have been manned in another era. Only pedestrians and motorbikers could use it,
since it was set on the edge of a moderately sized pedestrian town-square sort
of thing. Later on I would find people playing guitar and drums under the trees
on this square. 


Before anything else, I looked after my two most pressing matters: food and
finding a cheap home for the next few days. Right next to me was a hip-looking
little restaurant with wooden furniture, and though I had heard that tuk-tuk
drivers usually drop you off at expensive places that give them a commission,
after some not-terribly-energetic looking around I didn’t find anything
else, so I stepped in and had some kind of curry, which continued my streak of
loving every food made in Thailand. I took the opportunity to collect my wits
and try to absorb information from my guidebook. Once I finished I had arrived
at the conclusion that my best strategy would be to wander around nearby and
find something cheap. It worked: I found a place with very basic rooms that
suited my hobo sensibilities just fine, and a garden shaded by a massive
tamarind tree with seats that were perfect for hanging out but unused at this
morning hour, and paid 150 baht ($5) for a night. I left all my stuff there
except a little money and the clothes I was wearing. That done, I stumbled into
Chiang Mai unencumbered and with no idea what to do with myself.


I walked through the gate into the old city, enclosed by the wall, which is a
square about one mile to a side. I rented a bike from somewhere and just
started going around the city. There was a sanctioned list of interesting
temples to see in my guidebook, and that seemed like a good way to go about
things, so I went to each one in turn. As I biked around, I noticed that, for a
Thai city, Chiang Mai is oddly short on Thai people. All the signs were in
English. And they were for things like cafes and restaurants (with a selection
of Thai and Western food) and clothes stores. For the moment, though, I
didn’t worry about the fact that Westerners had taken the city over
completely; I was too charmed by how nice a place I had found myself in. The
food was delicious and cheap and everywhere; the transportation was all
low-powered, mainly bikes and motorbikes (southeast Asians do love their
motorbikes); it was quiet; and the buildings were inviting and often
interesting, for example the wall. There was just an atmosphere that I could
inhale for years. If I came upon an American city like this, I would start
looking for real estate.


The temples were smaller than similar ones I’d seen in Bangkok, but nice
enough, even if they all kind of started blending together after a while.
Here’s one:

After two or three, I kept on going to the next ones more out of a sense of
duty than out of a desire to see the next interesting temple. Each one had
several hundred years of history and an interesting backstory that made it
different from the others, but I never really knew the history or the stories;
all I saw was the present. (Except for the one time when a guy who teaches the
monks school lessons was sitting out front of a temple and told me a story that
I managed to forget within a day or so.) And I wasn’t even Buddhist, so I
couldn’t go in and bow three times to the Buddha image at the front of
the room like everyone else, or at least not without feeling ridiculous. Still,
I took lots of pictures, mainly of all the patterns, which are everywhere.
Micah told me before I left to keep an eye out for cool patterns. I’ve
got dozens of pictures of patterns to share with him now. And the advice: if
you want inspiration for patterns, move to a Buddhist country. They pave the
streets with them.


Templed out, I pedaled out to the river east of the old city to see life there.
It was much more Thai away from the walls, and much more crowded as well. Small
markets were budding and blooming in several places, and there were motorbike
repair shops and furniture stores and other practical things that a real city
needs besides restaurants and cafes. This made me feel a bit more like I was on
Earth. Then I just zigzagged around and enjoyed being in warmth during the
throes of January in an incredibly laid-back place, until I went back to the
hostel to find some phone numbers. Ahead of time, I had gotten in touch with a
few people from college who I’d never really known but who went there at
the same time as me and were now in Chiang Mai teaching various things. I asked
the proprietor if I could use the phone, but apparently she doesn’t have
one. Then a girl sitting at one of the tables under the tamarind tree said,
“You can use mine.”


I arranged when to meet, and since it wasn’t for about half an hour, I
ended up talking with her. For a vague assortment of small reasons, I think
I’m just going to call her H. She’s from Berkeley, and she had just
been working at a program where she taught teenagers about elephants.
There’s a wealth of places around Chiang Mai that you can go to to buy
pictures painted by elephants, or learn how to ride them, or train to be a
mahout (elephantmaster) for about a day. H was working at a place built to
counteract all of these other places, which apparently get the elephant to be
obedient by repeatedly poking it with a sharp stick until its soul breaks, an
idiom that’s the same in Thai. She also told me that along the
Thai–Burmese border, they use elephants to search for landmines, and
consequently some of the elephants she was caring for with the help of
teenagers were minus a foot. H loved the program immensely, but was still
reeling at the moment because she’d just been kicked out of it during a
scandal to do with strictly enforced lights-out hours, and I became a person
she could safely spill everything to, since all her other friends were asleep
in American time zones. She told me about herself and it turned out she was a
really great person, and we got along instantly and kept getting along. But
then I had to leave.


I met Aki, Alison, and Vicky at an ice cream place well to the east of the wall
and the river in a part of the city where there were lots of actual Thai
people, and we had Thai food together (one of them finally caved in to her urge
to try entrail soup), and we talked about college and what we’ve been
doing since and what we might do in the future, if we decide to have a future.
They also told me about stuff to do around town, and I made a mental note of
all of it. Then, since I didn’t really know them, we kind of ran out of
things to talk about, and we parted cordially and I was on my own again.


So I went to the night market, because H had told me there was a beer garden
and I’d never actually been to a place calling itself a beer garden. The only
thing I had to go off of was Daniel Pinkwater’s description of Ben Beanbender’s
Beer Garden, located in Tintown, a suburb of Baconburg, and arrived at by
taking an underground street named Lower North Aufzoo Street.  It’s probably my
favorite location in all of fiction. His description of it is a bit long for me
to slip in here as a casual aside, but briefly, it’s made of a circle of old
trucks and train cars, and the tables are spools and whatever else was handy,
and it’s lit by candles, and you can get a rich frothy beer plus a baked potato
filled with butter for fifty cents while you watch singing chickens or people
dancing with beers balancing on their heads or get talked to by the Grand
Shapoo of the Church of the Holy Home Run. And if you’re still curious you can
read a little more
[here](http://poesygalore.blogspot.com/2009/05/literary-food-porn-follow-up.html),
or better yet read the entirety of *The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of
Death*.


This meant I had high expectations, but fortunately I didn’t expect any
place in the real world to actually live up to them, so I wasn’t too
disappointed. After I made my way down a line of stalls selling really cheap
pure silk scarves and nifty trinkets that almost made me wish I were more
materialist so I could buy them and derive satisfaction from the act, I turned
down an alleyway and found myself in an open-air space, without any particular
shape that I could tell, lined with good stuff. Down one wall was a line of
counters where you could buy food (which I did even though I’d eaten) and
fresh fruit juice shakes and beers. Nearby was a stage where women were dancing
Thai dances, though they had the tired look of people who do this every night.
Over to the side were numerous places to buy cool hats or new wallets or pizza.
And back behind me was an abundance of massage chairs where I could get a
masterful massage for $5 an hour. I sat down at a plastic table near the dance
stage with a fruit juice shake and ended up talking for a long time with a
German anthropologist, which was more interesting than it might sound because
we talked about the native hill tribes in this area. These are peoples
who’ve been living out in the middle of nowhere all over this country and
the others around the region for hundreds or thousands of years, with
traditions spanning that whole time, but have lately become a curiosity for
tourists, causing them to change all their patterns and start performing their
showiest yearly rituals daily so people in T-shirts can take lots of pictures.
We agreed that this was a travesty.


He departed and I got a Thai massage, which was supremely satisfying but
would’ve been even more so if my masseur hadn’t been a very small,
light man. My knotty muscles craved something more brusque. But I still walked
home rather refreshed.


* * *


I woke up ready to cook. I had booked a spot in a cooking course and I headed
straight over to it, arriving early for the 9:00 start. I took a seat on the
floor around a low table in a room open to the outside with some people from
various parts of the British Empire, and then our tecaher came in and told us a
bit about the basics of Thai cooking. But before we could eat we had to get
good and hungry by going to the market. It was an amazing place. So many weird
new things!—rambutans, blood cubes, morning glory stems, freshly shredded
coconut, dragonfruit, pig offal—and that was just the beginning of it; I could
have asked “What’s this?” for hours. The teachers of the
three groups of the course bought stuff and we went back and got to cooking.


I was content as could be learning how to make all this extremely delicious
stuff. We got to choose from three different things during each of six
different slots. I picked pad Thai, which is easy and I’m going to be
making it all the time; spring rolls; coconut milk chicken soup, which sounds
weird and which I’d never tried, but it’s awesome; red curry paste;
deep-fried bananas; and khao soy, a local dish made with curry and deep-fried
noodles. Between each food we all got time to sit around the table and talk and
digest. Thus I passed much of the day. I have to say, it was pretty darn
relaxing, a lot of fun, and one of the tastiest days I’ve ever spent.


At 4:00 I was turned out onto the street with a new cookbook and a full
stomach, and tried to figure out what else I could do today. If I’d had
more time, I might’ve been content to sit under the tamarinds and relax
with a book or draw something, but I’d given up books as a time-wasting
luxury during these action-packed three weeks, and instead resolved to see the
sun set from Doi Suthep, a shining silver temple built atop the highest hill
northwest of town. So I got on my rented bike and rode.


It was too far, not by just a tantalizing small distance but by ten kilometers.
I thought it was just outside town. But what was just outside town was Huay
Kaew Waterfall, where I was free to climb until I reached a place where I
couldn’t go any further without gecko feet. Once I got there I turned
around and discovered that I had a view of everything. The sun was setting over
all of it, and it was golden. I found a trail that led to a higher vantage
point so I could see more of everything. There I let the day finish and the
light drain away.


Biking back to town, I ran across H telling stories of her life, which is
governed by unbelievable coincidences, to a woman who would have died in the
2004 tsunami in Phuket if her then-boyfriend hadn’t botched their
scuba-diving reservation. I didn’t have any really good coincidences to
share, besides when I was working at Manito-wish and I discovered I had a
mutual friend in Cincinnati with another person working there, and then
discovered I had a mutual friend in Cincinnati with a totally different person
working there, and they were the *same friend*, but I sat down with them
anyhow. I listened to stories that a fiction writer wouldn’t be able to
get away with, like the time H met a guy in Panamá and thought in passing,
“He’d be a great boyfriend for my friend,” and then three
years later met that friend of hers in a different country, maybe a different
hemisphere, and discovered that she was in a relationship with that exact man.
Then after a while we strolled to the night market together and walked around
looking at knickknacks and eating at the beer garden. We continued to have a
great time together, and decided that tomorrow we should go on a bike ride
together up to Huay Kaew waterfall, Doi Suthep, and a Hmong (hill tribe)
village near there. All this getting along might lead you to an easy
conclusion, but terribly dishearteningly, she’s not into men.

* * *


Even so, we still did that bike ride, after hanging around all day together and
wandering around half-randomly. We stopped in at the waterfall first and hung
out on it.


{% include fig.html src="SEAsia_100.jpg" %}

Then we took the trail well farther than I had, leading us to an enormous
rock that had presumably once rested on the ground, but had now had all the
soil below it undercut by erosion, so it was now suspended anywhere from zero
to seven feet above the rocks below it, supported only by the other rocks next
to it that it was connected to and that were connected solidly to the ground. A
caveman could live a pretty good life under there, getting water from the
stream, swimming below the waterfall. We wanted to swim, but when we looked at
the tire swing, it was being used by a gathering of fun-seeking orange-robed
monks, who aren’t allowed to be near women or immodest dress, which kind
of put that proposal out. These monks are all around town, by the way, in the
temples, on the streets. They make everything feel much more Thai.
They’re a wonderful presence at any place besides a swimming hole.
Instead of swimming we looked out over the town and had an unexpectedly deep
conversation.


We had gotten this far, but Doi Suthep was an awful long way away on a somewhat
expensive pickup truck ride, and H had heard stories that it was a tourist
anthill. We looked at the signs near the waterfall for the Hmong village and
concluded that it looked like they had to put on a constant farce of their old
ways to impress tourists, and decided that didn’t look so great either.
So we scrapped the plan and coasted back downhill to town.


We rounded off the night at a place blatantly called the THC bar, though pot is
actually not accepted there—you just go there to connect with a person
who’ll sell it to you. Instead what they have is a rooftop with carpets
and low tables where you just lounge, rather as if you were high and lazy, and
you drink beers. This is what H and I did, and we talked with a bunch of
British and Australian girls, but I can’t make friends with people who
are drunk, so I didn’t make any new friends there. I just talked a lot
with all of them, and the conversations were of course totally deep, like drunk
conversations are sometimes. We went to other bars, but by far what I enjoyed
most was when, on our way home, we passed by a Thai guy playing his guitar and
sat down at his table and talked with him. His brother showed up too.
They’re building a guesthouse together. We talked about Thailand and
tourism and it was interesting to get an insider’s viewpoint of all this
stuff happening in Chiang Mai. And also we drank and played guitar, because it
was far too late to be serious all the time.

* * *

That was about it for Chiang Mai. I got up, went with H to have khao soy that
the Thai guy with the guitar had recommended to us as the best in the city, and
then got on a bus and left. But that’s for next time.
