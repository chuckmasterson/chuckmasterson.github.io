Earlier on this summer, Misty moved out of her previous, dysfunctional house
(it billed itself as a community home, but it was actually a dictatorship,
ruled by a matriarch with deep issues but a gift for P.R. writing), and decided
to spend the summer camping out: here, there, wherever, just so long as she
could sleep outside most nights. That came to fruition during our Colorado
gathering, but before that big-time event we took a smaller excursion down to
Pike Island. This is a spot south of town where the Minnesota River flows into
the Mississippi, across from old Fort Snelling, the Civil War–era military
encampment turned historical monument.  Pike Island is extra special because
it’s just for walking. There are no roads to it, and before you cross the
footpath bridge to get there on the footpath, you have to lock up your bike at
a little series of racks in a shady grove. It’s an island with no tracks,
only footprints.

We arrived after dark and found a secluded patch of forest to set up our tent.
Once we were inside and out of the sprinkles that had started dripping on us
earlier, we took deep breaths. It was *quiet.* I had been living in
the city for over a year by this point, with only a few excursions into
wilderness areas, and I had gotten used to constant noise. Sprout House is just
a block away from an emergency dispatch station, and right next to a busy
multi-lane one-way full of commuters and big trucks trundling across town and
shaking the ground.

Misty had been in the city for about as long, but before that she’d been
in parks and forests and mountains, and she’d come to need the fresh air
you get there; she hadn’t gotten used to the city the way I had, so
getting out into the trees was for her *urgent*, and once we were
there, it was like coming up from a long dive into a cold, dark lake.

Some people are born into a hospital in New York City, grow up there, and never
leave for their entire lives. It’s possible for a human to adapt to that
kind of life. But I’m going to assert here that it’s not possible
to thrive. And I realized that, that night on Pike Island: I did have my eyes
set on a target out in the country, but I was content to complacently live
among the buzz and keep waiting for a long time, an amount of time that my
city-dwelling side was entirely satisfied with, but that would ultimately cause
a breakdown in my wilderness side, the far truer side submerged for so long
into the realm of imagination out of a necessity that wasn’t really
necessary.

Going to Colorado drastically sharpened that realization, and brought into
focus the fact that I can form a conviction to actually do something about it.
It seems at first like there’s not really a lot I can do, since at the
moment our group of four homestead dreamers is too poor to buy a parcel of
land. But getting the land is, to some extent, only one milestone somewhere
halfway down the road to our ultimate goal. Before we do that, there’s
the matter of gathering people and gathering knowledge and gathering money (and
gathering acorns to tide us over). Skills for living off the land and in
community can’t really be found in a book. The raw materials for them
can, for sure, by the tonload, but the real skills can only be found in your
body after it gets used to how the skill and the real world meet. John Michael
Greer says it takes most people about five years to really get the hang of
gardening and be able to make good decisions, as opposed to the halfway
nonsensical ones I’ve made this year, and the fully nonsensical ones I
would’ve made if more-experienced Peter and Maddy hadn’t been
around to bounce ideas off of. And Sprout House has already been a proving
ground for a bevy of potential sticking points that could come from living in
community, all of which we’ve managed to figure out how to deal with.

Out there in the Colorado woods we realized we’ve been doing practically
nothing in the city to further our dreams, besides amassing a little savings
and having a few vague dreams. Now that we’re back I’m checking out
library books, putting in time in the house garden and the farm that my
housemate Maddy works at, getting a bow and arrow, planning on harvesting wild
rice and hazelnuts, and just generally making sure that the things I do are
pointed toward my big goal, the main thing I consider important.

Because moving out to the land isn’t going to happen automatically. It
would be very, very easy (though in another sense, crushingly difficult) to let
the homestead idea turn into an idle, diaphanous dream that’s always ten
years in the future. We’ll all need to throw ourselves completely at this
idea to make it turn into reality, and even then it’s going to be
difficult. The homesteaders of the 1800s in Minnesota had long, cold winters,
crop failures, isolation, and a lot of effort in front of them to make sure
they scraped by. We have a few advantages in that we’ll have some
potential to make money in other ways, but really, it’s going to be a lot
of hard work and probably more disappointment than any of us are willing to
admit.

So why are we hurling ourselves at it? Well, two good reasons. We want to, and
we have to. We want to because living in the city is a plan that we’re
all pretty sure has an expiration date for us: we can’t take living amid
traffic and sirens and buildings for too long. We want to be able to see the
stars at night, not a uniform brown smog. We want to watch our food grow, not
buy it from farmers we’ll never meet.

But also, we need to, because the system of cities and industry is a foundation
of sand, and the tide is coming in. Right now, most people in this country, and
a lot of people worldwide, depend on the industrial system for everything that
makes up their lives: food, houses, water, electricity, roads, cars, computers,
industrial electric heaters. All fine while the system is working like
it’s supposed to. But the system itself depends on the Earth for
everything: petroleum, topsoil, rock phosphate, good weather. The Earth only
has so much of those that we can take from it.

And *that*, not any particular corrupt bank or pack of lobbyists, is why
everything seems like it’s falling apart.  Greece is going into default;
a sizeable chunk of the Eurozone will probably go with it eventually. Over here
the US insists that it’s still the richest country in the world, and
maybe it is, but you wouldn’t know it from the last ten years of news
about the infrastructure—interstate bridges have been collapsing, the power
grids are famously frail and vulnerable to disasters, water conduits are
showing their age, even the recently-constructed broadband networks have
outages all the time—and the government that funded the ground-up construction
of these things once upon a time now seems to be unable to even maintain them
beyond the most basic patches on the surface. Particularly in North America,
the fracking boom that was supposed to bring back resilient, ’50s-era
days of prosperity has shown that even just a dip in the price of oil can shut
down fields continent-wide. I haven’t been keeping up with news of
implosions everywhere in the world, but the pace really does seem to be picking
up.

People who predict that the industrial world will collapse seem to go through a
pattern of maturing. They start out young with an excitement fueled by
apocalypse movies and science fiction and predict that everything will go
kersplat pretty quickly and they’ll watch from the sidelines. Then they
do a little more studying and discover that collapses take a lot longer than
one big kersplat, and there won’t be one single day (or even one single
year) where all the cities empty out and the buildings get shuttered up and the
highways go silent and everyone who was wise returns to 1800s-looking
homesteads. Instead, the collapse will look like: everyone gets poorer (except
those who are both rich and circumspect), utilities get expensive and
unreliable and eventually unavailable to a lot of people, everything gets
stretched thinner and thinner, people either make do with less or fail to make
do.

There are two ways to live in that kind of era. One is to try to keep plugging
along in the old system, with or without the faith that everything will improve
one day and you’ll get the prosperity you thought you were implicitly
promised. That means a life that’s like what you’re used to, but
always makes you feel like you’re failing. The other way to live is to
ditch the system entirely and relearn everything about how to live.
That’s what we’re doing. It means that every routine you once found
comfortable has to be reevaluated, and you have to do everything yourself, and
a lot of problems you have won’t be solved by something you can pull off
the shelf. It’s scary ground that seems untrodden, even though the
reality is that the trails have just gotten a little overgrown.

Faced with that choice, there are a lot of people who would give up. “I
don’t want to relearn everything I ever knew. If doing things the way
I’m used to means I’ll die early, I guess I’ll die early.
It’s easier.” Yes, it is easier. It’s also easy to watch TV
all day. But we’re explorers. We have no time for TV and we have no time
to do things the way they’ve always been done. We have no time to lose if
we’re going to learn a way of life that’s totally new to us.
It’s long past time for us to find the old trails and blaze new ones of
our own. We’ve just gotten started.
