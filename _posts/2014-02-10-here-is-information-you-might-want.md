So here I am in Texcoco, a little to the east of Mexico City, staying with my
Couchsurfing host’s family. He’s an avid biker, and today we biked
30 km up hills that would have been cuss-worthy if I had any breath left to
cuss, to get to Teotihuacán, one of the ancient seats of Mesoamerican power. It
was made so long ago that no one knows exactly who made it -- it was made
around the years 1 to 150, and it was abandoned for about a thousand years
before archaeologists found it again, if I’ve got all this correct. The
showpiece of it is the Pyramid of the Sun, which in scale is more like a
mountain than a monument. Saying “233 feet” doesn’t really do
it justice; you have to say something like “the people at the top look
like festively colored insects”.

But that’s not the main reason I’m writing. I’m just checking
in to say that I made myself a calendar yesterday, and it appears I won’t
have time to do all the things I wanted to do if I follow the original
schedule, so there’s a possibility that I’ll allow myself an extra
few days. I have a dental appointment scheduled the 28th, so no later than that
theoretically, but it’s going to be an expensive dental appointment, and
I’ve been reading about the phenomenon of Americans coming to Mexico for
cheap yet quality dental care, so that might happen here too. At any rate,
I’m still more or less shooting for the 24th, but don’t be
surprised if it turns out I’m a little late. I’ll let you know my
expected return time when I’m closer to it.
