I got a pickup truck ride to the bus station. Pickups are another popular form
of public transportation here, besides the tuk-tuk. They have two rows of seats
in the back, much like the limos at Crowduck, and you just tell the driver
where you’re going before you get on. I got a bus to Chiang Khong, a town
on the Thai–Lao border. It seemed like a short distance on the map, but the
ride took seven hours. The time passed unremarkably. I heard a lot of Thai
music. The singers were earnest enough, but the instrumental part of it sounded
like it was recorded on a keyboard by a man named Sven who recently read a book
called *Thai Music: Theory and Practice*. Once we got away from Chiang Mai, we
started passing through places that looked much more authentic, where all the
houses were made out of bamboo and thatch, and there were country markets and
towns free of Westerners. I wished I were on a motorbike so I could stop at
these places and have a look around, maybe get a lunch and try to chat with
someone working at the restaurant. Oh well.


An efficient, quick-talking Thai woman was waiting for us at the bus stop with
flyers about her guesthouse and a pickup (without seats in the back) that we
could ride to it. It looked good so all the Westerners on the bus got in the
truckbed and went there. It turned out to be outstanding. They have a
restaurant looking out over the Mekong River, which was how I saw it for the
first time. The food was delicious and I played cards and talked about travel
with the other Westerners. Among them were an English guy and two very
attractive French girls; the English guy was traveling with them and talked
about his luck to have found “two French wives”. It was totally
quiet and calm aside from the karaoke that drifted in softly from a bar across
the river in Laos. I regretted that I’d be leaving so soon, because
I’d clearly found the perfect place to stay. Later the proprietor’s
boyfriend-husband-guy came out to the deck to talk to us. He’s from
Florida but speaks in a down-home Omaha drawl. (Which the French girls could
only understand about half of.) He told us things about Laos that we
didn’t know. Only ten years ago or so, it was impossible to go into the
country at all. Now it still hangs onto its communism, but is clearly going
capitalist, so they don’t want to let it show. The result is silliness
like the bus situation. Private bus companies are allowed to start in Laos, but
they can’t use the government bus station because that would ruin the
communist image. So they have to leave from some other place in town. If they
get prosperous they can start running another bus to a second destination, but
that bus has to leave from somewhere else. It’s hard to figure out where
to catch your bus in Laos. Tourism has barely started in Laos, and though
they’re really embracing it, it’s in its infancy and they’re
still figuring lots of things out. That appealed to me a lot.


In the morning, everyone interested got a free ride to the border post. This
was a little modular building near a dock. Once I filled out the appropriate
forms to say I was leaving Thailand, I paid a man 5 baht to ferry me across the
river on a boat as narrow as a canoe but shallower and at least twice as long.
This enabled me to walk up to Lao immigration, a collection of three little
modular buildings surrounding a small square at the top of steep steps and
covered with dozens of people all waiting for their passports to be suitably
examined and processed. There was no line, just a crowd. It took an hour, but I
got mine done and hurried off to get a ticket for the slowboat.


To get to Luang Prabang, you can take a bus, sure, but the Mekong has been
taking people from one place to another much longer than any highway has, and
it’s a lot prettier to boot. The Mekong is the region’s big river,
the tenth largest in the world, draining part of China and most of the
countries of Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia. It’s old and wild and
mysterious and full of fish big enough to swallow you that live nowhere else in
the world. So with my ticket I boarded a boat a little wider than a bus but
probably as long as three. It had a roof but instead of having windows it was
open-air.

As I got on I discovered with some dismay that the boat was completely full of
Westerners. Evidently the Lao people stopped using boats to get to Luang
Prabang in two days when the bus started being able to do it in one. Now the
only people still traveling by the old impractical method are people who have
nothing to do and like scenery: tourists. But I wrote it off to fate or
modernization, and sat down on a repurposed car seat next to a guy named Mark
and waited for the journey to begin.


The boat was running on Lao time. My guidebook was quick to stress that Laos is
a supremely unhurried country. I sat on the boat for a long time, chatting with
Mark a little, and people slowly started speculating on when it might actually
leave. A guy had lost his bag, so we figured once that was cleared up
we’d get going. But then he found it and we were still docked, so we had
to figure that the reason was more obscure or mystical. The engine might be
misbehaving—though we hadn’t heard anyone even try to start it yet. Many
suspected that the driver was just waiting until the time was right: at the
moment, the river wasn’t properly auspicious. After a while the engine
abruptly chugged to life, a cheer arose from the passengers, and we nosed out
into the river.


The Mekong is not, like the Mississippi, a broad, slow, stately river.
It’s narrow and fast and lined with big, jagged, black rocks. The banks
are rarely sandy and flat, and nowhere do they flatten out to a big plain or
anything of the sort. Instead they jump directly out of the water and continue
toward the sky to become mountains. Each mountain is covered in forest that
grows with the special vigor that you only find in the tropics. There’s
nothing to make plants calm down once a year here, take a rest and wait until
next spring, so they grow non-stop, ever bigger, and on every patch of soil
that isn’t constantly hacked back to zero. Sometimes they grow in other
plants, or even around them. I saw trees during my trip that had been embraced
and then strangled by vines that had now replaced the tree, in the same shape
but hollow inside. The tropics are a restless place. I stared out of the boat
and watched mountain after restless mountain go by. Any one of them would be
amazing, but now I had an unbroken chain of them.


I took a look at the boat’s engine and it looked like it had been pulled
from a semi truck. Whatever the case, it made conversation impossible, so I had
nothing to do but watch what was happening along the banks. Just a few minutes
down from the launch, I saw a group of kids skinny-dipping near some beached
canoes. A little later cows started appearing, grazing along the banks,
drinking some water, flipping their ears around. This gave me a peaceful
feeling. Sometimes there would be a person leading the cows from one place to
another. Once, we stopped at a place where there was no apparent dock and let
someone on or off, and a bunch of kids crowded up to the boat trying to sell us
beers (these are the kids in the picture). They didn’t sell very many
because the boat didn’t stay long, but they seemed pretty cheerful about
it nonetheless. On almost every mountain, it seemed, we would pass a little hut
made of wood and thatch, nearly invisible against the enormity of the hill
behind it, like a fly on a mammoth’s back. Later, in the afternoon, we
passed through some narrow spots with rapids that were at least a little bit
worrying. But the pilot seemed to have waited for just the right moment and the
river let us pass unharmed.


I was enjoying the scenery, but it wasn’t changing much, so I thought
I’d go up front away from the engine noise and see if there was anyone
interesting on the boat. But alas, there wasn’t. The front had become a
gathering of people who were playing drinking games with Beerlao from the store
at the back and talking about parties past and future. Others had taken out
their iPhones and were playing games. I didn’t understand why they
bothered to get on the boat at all. They clearly weren’t getting much out
of the scenery.


We stopped for the night at a place called Pakbeng, which used to be a real
village but now serves only as a place for tourists to sleep and eat until the
boat starts up again the next morning. Waiting for us at the dock were guys
saying furtively, “Pst. Hey. S’mohk wíd? O·pee·um? You got
girlfriend, you want big room, boom-boom?” I avoided them, but they still
made me depressed. I found a restaurant and had *làap*, a quintessentially Lao
dish made of minced meat mixed with various shredded leaves, including lots of
cilantro. Delicious. Then I sought out places to sit quietly with people and a
beer and talk, which led me to discover fun facts like the fact that working in
Australia, especially in mines, can be extremely profitable. But soon I’d
had enough and I just slept.


We had a similar delay getting started the next morning, but eventually we did
start moving, and I sat closer to the front to get away from the engine, a
decision that worked out really well for me. It turned out there actually were
people on the boat who weren’t completely vapid, and I got to know an
18-year-old who’s fished off the coast of Alaska for the last four
summers, a guy who climbed on top of the boat yesterday, and a girl who likes
canoeing. She and I got along pretty well, but over the next few days we
repeatedly failed to ever meet each other when we were trying to meet each
other—we’d just pass each other on the street and exchange quick words
and then go where we’d been going. It was actually funny.


Along the banks were more cows, and more huts, but also more interesting stuff.
We saw a man go up alongside a cow and get on it, then lead the other cows
along behind it. The rapids got more intense, barely wide enough for the boat.
The black rocks were threatening to dash us asunder from either side. On top of
them, here and there, I could see little concrete towers about four feet high.
I couldn’t figure it out, but discussed it with my neighbors, and we
decided the Mekong must do some serious flooding in the rainy season and those
are markers to keep extremely intrepid boats from scraping bottom during the
floods. The tops of these markers were at least eight feet above current
surface. Around the middle of the day, the most amazing thing happened: two
guys came into view escorting an *elephant* along the crumbly steep banks. It
looked like an amazing and absolutely terrifying job.

People were starting to make comments like “I’m ready to be off
this boat” when Pak Ou Cave appeared, telling us that Luang Prabang was
close. It’s a crevice in a solid vertical wall of limestone right along
the riverbank. If I had been kayaking I could’ve paddled to the wall and
touched it. Inside the crevice are hundreds and thousands of old Buddha images.
Apparently when you no longer need a Buddha image in Luang Prabang, you take it
to Pak Ou to get rid of it. We got only a meager glimpse at the cave but were
able to fully enjoy the rock wall. Within a half hour or so, we had reached the
boat dock at Luang Prabang. Everyone got their stuff and cleared off the boat.
I guess I was a little less anxious than most, though.
