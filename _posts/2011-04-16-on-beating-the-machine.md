A couple months ago, this strip came out on xkcd, a webcomic that I read: 

{% include fig.html absolute=true src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/let_go.png"
%}

([xkcd No. 862](http://www.xkcd.com/862))

What really made me stop and pay attention wasn’t the punch line, which
is kind of inscrutable really, but the alt-text, which is a thing this guy does
where some words pop up when you hover your mouse over the picture when
you’re reading it on the site. The alt-text, unusually long, goes like
this: “After years of trying, I broke this habit in a day by decoupling
the action and the neurological reward. I set up a simple 30-second delay I had
to wait through, in which I couldn’t do anything else, before any new
page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge
to check all those sites magically vanished--and my
‘productive’ computer use was unaffected.”

I don’t know if I’ve talked about it much, but for a long time
I’ve had the same exact problem that Luke here had. I became addicted to
the internet—I’m convinced that that’s the best way to explain what
happened. Most nights, if I had a computer (which I usually did) and nothing in
particular to do, I would stay up until about 3:00 reading things I
didn’t really have a compelling reason to read. Mainly it was webcomics
and funny things. I enjoyed the stuff I was reading, but the problem with funny
stuff on the internet is that even though you enjoy it, there’s just
*so much *funny stuff on the internet. Everyone knows the internet is
first and foremost full of porn, but underneath that, there’s another
thriving layer of funny stuff. It’s impossible to read and watch it all.
But for a long time I tried my darnedest. It was really a problem. It cut into
my sleep schedule, and it cut out my interactions with real people. I knew it
was a problem, too, and I wrote about it in my journal night after night. Each
night I would say something like: “Then I spent too much time on the
internet and then went to sleep.” At first this would be accompanied
with, “No more of this. I will improve.” Later on it became,
“All right, that was ridiculous. No more internet for the rest of the
week, outside essential stuff like emails.” And then there were
variations like, “I went way over the one hour I allotted myself for
internet today. I’ll take it out of tomorrow’s allowance.”
But I always slipped back into the same old patterns.

Then that xkcd comic came out, with an alt-text that talked about a solution
that sounded downright workable. I had no idea how to implement a 30-second
delay like the one he talked about, but I found an add-on that I could install
on my browser that does something similar. It’s called
[StayFocusd](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji).
It only works on Chrome, but there are things like it for other browsers, like
Firefox. The basic principle is that you give it a list of sites where you
waste a lot of your time, and it allows you a certain amount of time per day to
spend looking at those sites. There are all sorts of customizations you can do,
depending on how much self-control you have and how high your standards are for
yourself. You can allow yourself certain unproductive hours each day, when
you’re free to visit whatever sites you want, if you’re not too concerned about
that. Or on the other hand, you can set it so that to change any settings (like
to give yourself more time, or to take some sites off the list), you first have
to type a paragraph about procrastination, letter for letter, with no typos and
no backspacing. I’ve tried it. It’s pretty much impossible.

It’s sort of a booster for self-control. I have it set to allow me 15
minutes a day. By now I’ve gotten pretty used to not going to all the
sites I used to go to for screwing around. In fact, I feel like I may even have
managed to get myself to lose the taste for them—although I haven’t tried
taking turning off the add-on yet. I might do that sometime in the future, but
for now it’s too useful, and my life is too stressful—I always want to
blow off some steam by watching stupid YouTube videos or something. What
I’m getting at, though is that I feel like I’ve finally succeeded
at kicking my years-long internet addiction, and, well, it feels really good.

Speaking of a stressful life! The past couple weeks have been possibly the
busiest ones I’ve ever had here. In the last nights, I’ve pulled an
all-nighter, then slept for five hours, then slept for 3½ hours. I’ve
also slept partway through two classes while napping off my sleepless nights.
It’s because my due dates for all of my classes all coalesced in these
two weeks. On the all-nighter, I was writing up the results of my analysis of
the data from my MAP. It took forever, but in the end, it was cool, because it
confirmed my hypothesis, or at least one of them. On the five-hour night I had
to write a methods section for an imaginary research proposal, like the MAP
proposal I wrote, except that I’m not actually going to do this project.
Last night was the 3½-hour night, which was when I was writing a literature
review for my class about mapping stuff. All very time-consuming stuff. Before
that was more, different, time-consuming stuff. I’ve been pretty much
unable to breathe for two weeks. This weekend I can catch up on sleep, and then
do things, things that I want to do.

I could write about how I interviewed with Flying Cloud today, or about how I
sent off my documents to the government to get apostilles for them, which are
basically super-notarizations, so the South Korean government will accept them,
or about how I went to the bank because I left my checkbook at Ohio but instead
of checks I got $2 bills and then went and bought money orders (but not with
the $2 bills). But I’m tired, so I’ll just give a rundown of how
cool today was. I went and saw *True Grit* for free on campus, and it was
excellent; then on my way back to my room there were people selling frybread
from a window, and one of them was even a Native American (Tlingit, from
southern Alaska—I mentioned *Smoke Signals* and we agreed it was good that
I was finally getting an authentic Indian frybread experience); then there was
a bunch of standup comedy and stuff. I’m feeling more content than I have
in a while. But less eloquent, more rambly. So I’m going to quit writing
before this gets any more incoherent. Someday, my blog entries will stop being
boring and aimless. But that day is not today.
