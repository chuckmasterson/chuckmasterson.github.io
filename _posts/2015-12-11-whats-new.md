The New River in West Virginia is one of the oldest rivers in the world, at
least 260 million years old (you can tell because it crosses the immensely
ancient Appalachians, which means it was there first). The New Bridge (Pont
Neuf) in Paris is the oldest bridge in the city. It was new once, but now all
the bridges it was newer than have been replaced.

Just thought you might like to know.
