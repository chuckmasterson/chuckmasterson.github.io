I don’t want to alarm anyone too much, but the trusty old Sprout House
got broken into today. I came home and everyone was looking around to figure
out what was gone and . They got my computer, which is the main thing, and also
a lockbox I had that was holding my passport and a bunch of legal documents and
Great Grandpa’s savings bonds. I don’t know if it’s possible
to get anything from those savings bonds. If I can’t cash them, the
thieves sure won’t be able to, since they’ve got my name on them,
so I guess it’ll just mean the government gets to keep the money. But it
looks like there’s some form I can fill out where they can try to search
for them to replace them. (Anyone got the serial numbers? Otherwise I’ll
just have to guess at the dates.)

On that computer were all my travel photos. I waited just that little bit too
long to put them on the internet. The possible good news is that, depending on
when I uploaded them to my old computer, I might have the pictures from Europe
when Dad sends me my old computer. But I don’t think I’ll have any
way of getting a hold of my pictures from my travels around North America.
We’ll see what’s on my computer. They’re probably gone for
good -- unless the computer turns up. We filed police reports and
everything, so I guess we can hold out some hope. I’m going to watch
Craigslist for a computer matching my model. We’ll call around to the
pawn shops.

Other than the photos, nothing’s irreplaceable; I’m just out money.
So far that’s a bike, a computer, and a passport. Everything else about
Minneapolis is great, but this theft thing is getting pretty old. We’ve
got to keep our windows closed better. That’s about all the insight I
gain from that.
