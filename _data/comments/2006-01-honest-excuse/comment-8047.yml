text: "Well you have definitely given me another reason to consider taking your brother out of this school system. I just have to get your dad to agree...which won't be easy. I would have done it for you, too, but things seemed to go more smoothly in the early days. I am very disappointed in what has happened to F-town schools lately. In your class, the politically correct gewgawish brainwashing dumbed down agenda. Which, thankfully, I see not everyone buys into.<br/>In Micah's class it's the uncontrollable, ridiculous lack of control. Those kids fight and scream. Not only has Micah been bullied, the other day two girls got into a fight to the point one cracked open the other's head. Kelly and Reba, Micah's buddies. Can ya believe this. It's not that kids don't fight, because they do. It's that there is that amount of unsupervised time that allows them to get into this trouble. If there were more control and authority, they wouldn't be allowed to get in situations like this. Every school has is fights but FMS seems to just have a lot more than usual even without Billy the bully. I'm frankly a little tired of this and yes, we will be moving from Finneytown at some time. We have work yet to do on the house. I know I wanted to let you finish at FHS since it does have a good reputation, and as ridiculous and contradictory the policies and politics are, at least you are getting a good grounding in the core areas. <br/>Ignore the vegetable rights activists. They are but a small BB compared to the vast armies of them swarming around any US college campus today. Be nice to them, say no thank you to them in a nice polite voice, and then eat lots of juicy pike and bass on Lake Kabetogema or Milles Lacs or any one of the coves and bays in the Land of 10,000 tax-oops, I meant Lakes.<br/>I will be frequenting your retreat and I hope that you will be able to achieve this dream. You are so much like your dad in that regard. That's why it's vital that we move to the country and none to soon. I myself am content in the country or the city but find myself the only one as your brother is also a budding outdoorsman.<br/>God has blessed you with a love and longing for His creation. This is indeed how He has created people, especially men. Men need to be outdoors, and some men more than others. Just please don't leave your old mom all alone! (OK, you know I will let you have your space and I always have, but I am your mom and I love you more than my life.)"
