Wow thats blew my mind and I never imagine there is a train that you can jump on and get a ride for free. Well  your story about ojibwe reminds me to my self when Korean people thought that I am foreigner who completely could not speak Korean and I just held my laugh. Btw I have to extend more in Korea for 6 months since my thesis doesnt go smoothly (My subject is downtoner in Korean). \r\n\r\n-alfi-"
