text: "How great you were able to bike around Chicago!  I took an architectural tour (on a boat on the Chicago River) a couple of years ago and can appreciate all the fun you had down there.  Good for you!<br /><br />I&#39;m glad Deb has Tenzing.  They&#39;ll do fine together.  And you know he won&#39;t be forgotten!<br /><br />We hope you have a fantastic time in Korea.  It sounds just right for you.  Enjoy....<br /><br />Aunt E."
