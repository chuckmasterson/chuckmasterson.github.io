text: "Wow!  Glad you got a chance to have such an interesting visit to Chicago, and get exercise besides.  So can you get up here sometime before you leave?  If not, can we come down there and see you?  Gotta say our goodbyes--a year is a long time.<br /><br />Maybe we could have a farewell dinner together?   Call us when you have time.<br /><br />We had a good time in Germany, but we&#39;re jet lagged and trying to rest to catch up.  Grandma"
