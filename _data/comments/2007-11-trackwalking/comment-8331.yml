text: "It would appear it is working.  Good.  I did a stupid thing yesterday and fell while I was walking Phoenix.  I banged up my elbow, knees, hands, and sprained my ankle.  Stupid.  So I'm hobbling around here today and complaining to myself about how stupid I am.  At least after I fell I kept going on so Phoenix could use his favorite bathroom location at the golf course.  Hope you are doing well.  Let us know if you need a ride any time soon so we can plan for it.  Love, Grandma"
