text: "While I was at Feral this year I saw a button that said <span style=\"font-variant:small-caps;\">Make America not exist again</span>. That's my favorite spin-off so far and I really want that on a shirt, but a hoboing one would also be good.\r\n\r\nMental illness is an interesting concept. Someday I'll have to write a whole post on it, but the capsule version is that I've lately been seeing an increasing number of people saying that what we call mental illness could also be accurately described as normal, healthy reactions to an insane environment, along the lines of the pacing and perseverations that you see in zoo animals. We're all dealing with something very unlike the situation the human species grew up with, and whether you count that as a gain or a loss or something in between, the knock-on effect is that there are some people who are able to gracefully take on the new kinds of roles that are available, and some people who can't hang, and have to deal with this era in ways that make them unable to provide for themselves in the peculiarly narrowed set of ways that are allowed now. You could call the inability to work within the new world an illness, but the way it's damaging to the individual who has it is really very different from the way a flu hurts you. The flu attacks your body directly and causes it to shut down. And a lot of mental illnesses, of course, are pretty direct, like cerebral palsy making someone unable to do a lot of things that are necessary to survival. But then there are the more social \"mental illnesses\", like ADD---where the reason it's counted as an illness is basically \"you fidget too much to fit for your round peg to fit in the square hole that the education system provides, so we're going to medicate your innate tendencies into something more malleable\"---that is to say, it's an illness only because the culture around doesn't like those behaviors, and would prefer they be stamped out. That stamping out works on a lot of different levels and I would say it's often the cause of more \"illness\" than it tries to prevent.\r\n\r\nHuh, so much for capsule version. My thoughts on this are still not very fully worked out, though, or bounced off of many people who actually live with these conditions. In any case, what I'm getting at is that what our personalities are capable of constrains our life choices almost the same way outside circumstances do, and though I can spend long hours on a computer, I think if I did that year after year, even though I'm pretty mentally stable, it would take a severe toll on me. Towards the end of being in Minneapolis working on web stuff, I noticed some of the beginnings of a bad mental state beginning to eat in at the edges of my psyche, and had a *need* to get out. So to some degree I believe it'd be completely legitimate to say that I *don't* have the option of the 9-to-5-to-65 route for life---it would feel like a prison and I couldn't live with myself for just grinning and bearing it.\r\n\r\nNot to put myself on a level with people who are born into poverty and live on the streets all their lives. I enjoy a lot more latitude in my options than that. I have the connections, education, and constitutional ability to spend some time hunkering down and making money to make enough money that I'll probably never starve or get wrapped up in gang violence trying to survive. My options are nowhere near as constrained as most people's on this planet are. But it's interesting to take this stuff apart and look at it from other angles."
