  Probably true. But is your point that we're not "real" hoboes because we could
  choose not to be? Because (a) some of the Depression hoboes probably *were*
  doing it by choice. The guys Steinbeck wrote about in *Tortilla Flat* (which
  is fiction, but apparently he was a bit hurt when people suggested he was
  making it all up for a cute story, and said the characters were based on
  people he'd really known) could probably have found steady work if they'd been
  so inclined, but they would rather sleep in the woods and drink gallons of
  wine with every dollar they earned. And (b) What, really, is the point in
  dividing modern-day nomads into "real" and "fake" hoboes?
