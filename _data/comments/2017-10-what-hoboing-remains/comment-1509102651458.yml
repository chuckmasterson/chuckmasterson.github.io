text: "Well, anyone who would rather lay in the woods drinking gallons of wine with every dollar they earned, likely has severe mental illness and substance abuse problems. My wife works with this population everyday. Some would rather live on the banks of the Ohio and always know where to get a free drink.\r\n\r\nNot trying to classify anyone as a real or fake hobo. Just guessing that most people in the 1930's didn't really have life choices to make. I think most people took the only roads or options they had, but of course there were exceptions. My wife has oil paintings made by her great great grandmother. We know little about her, but anyone who had the time or means to live a life of leisure 100 years ago does intrigue me. I wish we knew more about her, but her story has vanished, gone and buried in untold history.\r\n\r\nSounds like you are living the life you want, I say great! You could design and sell hats saying \"make hoboing great again\"."
