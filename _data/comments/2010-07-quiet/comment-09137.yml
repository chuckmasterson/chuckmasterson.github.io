text: "You will be glad to know that we experienced nature in all its fullness at Crow Duck.  The weather was perfect, the fishing was productive and we saw the wolves in the wild.  Not bad.  But even in Crow Duck Eden there are the sounds of the lawn mowers and the boat engines and the hum of the water pump and the generator.  But above all that, the sounds of the loons are loud and  clear.  Grandma"
