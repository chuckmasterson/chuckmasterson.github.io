text: "I can&#39;t help thinking about how different your summer would have been had you spent it in the Chicago area.  The city itself would have held some similar features.  Thanks to Daniel Burnham, the Chicago shoreline has attractive parks and museums, and the only noise to the east is the sound of boats in the lake.  However,you&#39;d have spent more time in the &#39;burbs, where you might not have felt quite so boxed in, but you also would have been in a more familiar midwest environment and not found the new challenges you ultimately faced completely on your own.<br /><br />As I sit here in the &#39;burbs at 10:30 on a Sunday night, with the windows open for the first time in weeks (it finally cooled down here), I hear the sounds of motorcycles on the highway a few blocks away.  Occasionally a train goes by, and sometimes heavy trucks.  The cars become white noise.  But besides that I can hear an occasional cicada and even an early cricket.  In the mornings the birds do their singing nearby.  And yes, we hear the neighbors&#39; dogs sometimes.<br /><br />In Chicagoland you would have met different people, hopefully ones you&#39;d have enjoyed, but you probably wouldn&#39;t have had the depth of experience you are having in urban New York.<br /><br />While we&#39;d have enjoyed having you here, I believe you&#39;ve gained so much more by doing what you did.  I hope you have no regrets.<br /><br />Aunt E."
