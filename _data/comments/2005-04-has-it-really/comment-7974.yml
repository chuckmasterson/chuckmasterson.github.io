text: "Ah, college.  Pardoning my language in advance, the whole process is like visiting the proctologist without ass anesthetic.  I promise that's the last time I swear on a post.<br/><br/>By the way, it's always nice when one's belief in the power of human communication is reinforced and words turn into deeds.<br/><br/>Anywho, having just gotten all of my acceptance letters back (but still awaiting my cursed financial aid letters), you shouldn't worry about money.  Pretty much every school you apply to will be tumbling head over heels to make sure you walk in their doors.  Also, if you qualify for $X,000, then they are obligated to make sure that you get $X,000.  The financial aid process is grueling, invasive, tedious, and frustrating, but it does pay off.  Did I mention invasive?  Mrs. Bonnell, be prepared to have strangers pour over how you spend your money and how you make it.  My mom and dad had to send in their W2's, federal tax returns, schedules, FAFSA, and pay $100 in fees to fill out the CSS Profile which most private colleges require.  But, there is a saving grace in all of this.  Chances are, you will be a National Merit Scholar, and that counts big.  In terms of state schools, that ensures something close to a full ride.  At private universities, that ensures you of some scholarship money, depending on a variety of things.  But this is all stuff you should be thinking about next year, not now.  The main ticket is is to continue all the good stuff your doing now, make sure you get straight A's (no excuses), and keep taking the hardest and best classes.  Also, picking up another extracurricular could only help.<br/><br/>If you and your parents really feel like this is something you need to start taking action on RIGHT NOW, then I can give you the name and number of the college advisor my parents hired.<br/><br/>Enough about college.  As a senior, it's sometimes hard to remember that the rest of the world isn't obsessed about the whole process.<br/><br/>I have also noticed mistakes in the Harry Potter books.  Normally, I don't allow that kind of thing to slow my pace.  However, a friend provoked me recently in a letter she sent me, teasing me for being \"Mr. Perfect Grammar and Spelling.\"  So, I sent her letter back to her with everything corrected including a detailed accounting of why each mistake was wrong.  I doubt Grace will ever talk to me again.<br/><br/>Someday, I will have to go on a search for a Number 3 pencil.  But not today.<br/><br/>BJ"
