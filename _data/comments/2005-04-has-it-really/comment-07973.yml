text: "Don't worry so much about the tuition. Work on getting scholarships. If you get accepted into a really good school, we WILL find a way to pay for it. You can help by saving a little by getting a job. But there are lots of scholarships, and Grandma and Grandpa are experts at finding out where those are. Gerry's son is getting a mostly full-ride scholarship from NYU and he's not as smart as you are (and he is smart). Get the grades, do your best. We (your parents) will also have a little help. If the school you get accepted to asks 40K a year and we end up paying a tenth or half of it, we will. We have set up investments just for that purpose. For you and your brother. That's why we complain sometimes about \"being poor\". We are living off the money that we are NOT setting aside. Your dad puts 15% into his 401K. Whatever job I am doing at the time will go directly to wherever you go to school and to help with your apartment or dorm if you have to move out. Believe it or not I actually had jobs in college that paid some of the things my parents couldn't at the time- they had not received an inheritance yet, farm money, paid off the house, or any of that. So even though I had free tuition sometimes I dipped into my own money my grandparents had given me over the years. (And grandma and grandpa have a little set aside for you, too). I know, I know I always whine and worry about this but we WILL get you through. I do not want you paying off loans until you're 50.<br/>Proofreading is good if you're at a big name place. It may not pay a bunch to start but just see if they can live without you. I would not only proofread but advise a publishing company of the entire layout of a book- the font, the graphics, the margins- and then also do the proofreading. Getting into publishing and writing with an emphasis also in graphic arts is going to be your thing. You could work for a name like Simon & Schuster or a big magazine or newspaper. :) Love, Mom"
