text: "We had the same 2 warm days in the 50's. Then the front that passed you passed over us last night. The winds sounded like a typhoon. Lots of things got blown over around here, and some places had thunderstorms. Then- back to the cold for us, too. Really no snow to speak of from it though we had a few flurries after the rain and thunder."
