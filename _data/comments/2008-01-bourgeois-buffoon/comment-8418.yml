text: "I'm on the Dean's List? Wow. I swear, this is the first word I've heard of it. How did you find out? That seems like the kind of thing they'd email me about. (Maybe they did; I get a ton of emails and I may have missed one or two.)<br/><br/>I did know that my GPA is 3.675, but I didn't know that entailed a listing."
