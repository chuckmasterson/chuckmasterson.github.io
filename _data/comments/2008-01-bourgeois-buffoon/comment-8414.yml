text: "Yesterday it got into the 50s, so he's basically a mound now. I think it's pretty hilarious how it's been below freezing the entire time I've been back so far, except yesterday and the day I built. Today it went directly back down to a high of 25, a low in I think the single digits, and winds steadily blowing at probably 30 mph to bring the windchill to -15. So, he's a solid mound."
