text: "You must have talked to my doctor.  At least three of those unpronounceable meds are ones I take regularly.  And they&#39;re supposed to keep me alive in my olden age.  (And a fourth med you named is one I&#39;m allergic to.)<br /><br />But I really had to laugh when you defined a &quot;problem&quot; as &quot;quality service opportunity&quot;.  One of my bosses at my last job had recently been in a training program to become a manager.  I can&#39;t tell you how many times he insisted there were no &quot;problems&quot;, only &quot;opportunities&quot;!  And that was about 19 years ago!<br /><br />Sure hope your new job turns out better!<br /><br />Aunt E."
