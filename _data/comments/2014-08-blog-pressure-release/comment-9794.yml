text: "Nathanael, I can&#39;t tell you how happy I am that you don&#39;t have to stay with Express Scripts!  You have described in beautiful detail what I have to go through with all medicines I may need.  It has been a nightmare.  Now if only I could leave Express Scripts, too.  Ha.  I have stories, oh, I have stories.<br /><br />It was a good job, because you learned what you DON&#39;T ever want to do for a living.<br /><br />I agree with David about the diets.  All this stuff goes by fads.  You live long enough, it recycles, and in the meantime, people live and die by whatever diet they&#39;re on.<br /><br />I don&#39;t agree with David about going without medicine, though.  I was brought up with that philosophy, and if it works, it works, but when it doesn&#39;t work you become very dead very quick.  Or live a miserable life.  Ask me sometime about my Aunt Teen.  <br /><br />Grandma"
