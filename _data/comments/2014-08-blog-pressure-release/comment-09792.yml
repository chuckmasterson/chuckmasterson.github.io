text: "My two observations:<br /><br />- I agree, the medical system is broken. My personal philosophy is to stay off of all medicines at all cost.<br /><br />- I disagree with any diet theory that exists. I&#39;ve seen too many people who are alive and healthy only because they won the genetics lottery.  All the special diet, special rules people I&#39;ve known get just as sick, just as often as the rest of us.<br /><br />Dave"
