text: "Tracy, I wasn&#39;t implying that you guys were trying to follow a biblical marriage. However, I think most people do, or pretend to do so. I am advocating the separation of church and state, which, I would think you guys would advocate.<br /><br />I think it would make christians and secular people happy to have two separate distinct concepts of marriage. Individual states could write whatever marriage laws they want and gays could be included. It would have nothing to do with religion, which would please most people.<br /><br />Christians could follow the bible and marriage as it is laid out in scripture. We would follow our ways and the consequences of success or failure within biblical parameters. Gays would not be allowed a christian marriage, making christians happy.<br /><br />Two complete different marriages, under two distinct separate authorities. It would slove all of the gay marriage issues, and I think it would make all people pay closer attention and take marriage more seriously.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents!<br /><br />Dave"
