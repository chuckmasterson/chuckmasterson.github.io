text: "Dan, that image is truly gross!  Nathanael, I&#39;m going to work on cookies pretty soon.  Can you suggest something you&#39;d like your mother and me to do Christmas decoration-wise in your house?  If it&#39;s something you want, she&#39;ll probably get interested in doing it for you.   She needs help getting motivated this year.  Grandma"
