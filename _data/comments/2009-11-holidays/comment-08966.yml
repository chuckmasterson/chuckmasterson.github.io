text: "I predict someone will get torn a new one pretty soon here. As for my part, we actually discussed this sort of thing in my intro to sociology class last year. The upshot is that marriage has meaning, because it&#39;s a binding contract between the two peeple getting married. That is to say, it&#39;s a commitment, one that involves a long-term pledge for two peeple to be together, and often things more tangible, such as children and changing names. It&#39;s the best and, excepting I suppose civil unions, the only way we have in Western society to indefinitely connect two people. If marriage becomes something reserved for the religious, and the nonreligious have to get by with promises that have no legal backing and aren&#39;t kept on record or given any cultural weight, then there&#39;ll be a pretty ugly revolt on the part of the nonreligious, but we don&#39;t have to worry because that&#39;ll never happen. In a nutshell, there&#39;s a big difference between declaring, &quot;Tracy and I are now married,&quot; and actually getting married officially, and those differences aren&#39;t to do with spirituality. You have some sort of point in that lawyers and divorcing are a problem, but you&#39;ve severely understated the benefits by calling them &quot;practically none&quot;. And if you plan to say that a lot of them are psychological, remember that we&#39;re a species with psyches. <br /><br />Dan the Married Atheist, care to take it further?"
