text: "Okay, here&#39;s my .02. First: I believe God blesses marriage, whether it&#39;s performed in a church or civil court. Say 2 atheists are married in a civil court and then they convert to Christianity. Do they then have to re-marry in a church? I don&#39;t think so. In the eyes of God they are married, whether they believe in God or not.<br />Second: If we follow Biblical examples of marriage, let&#39;s make sure we follow the correct ones. If we follow the examples of David and Solomon, we allow mass polygamy. If we follow the instructions in Paul&#39;s letters, we&#39;d do much better. Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church. If we want to get really specific about the Biblical example of marriage, we&#39;d have to learn the ancient Jewish practices-brideprice, etc.- I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t want to practice all the customs the Jewish people used to do. In a lot of those marriages the girl didn&#39;t have a choice in who she was marrying. The Biblical parameters we DO want to follow are the ones about love, mutual respect, selflesness, commitment, beauty, a union of 2 people in the eyes of God. Now that we have the choice to choose our own partners, fall in actual love, love another person more than self, without any aspects of it being a business deal or property arrangement- isn&#39;t that beautiful? God set us free from the matchmakers and allowed us to find our own partners. Solomon said happy is the man with one wife, though he himself had hundreds of wives...I think he saw the advantage in having that union of 2. Polygamy causes so much trouble...but some people still practice it, including some Christians. Anyway, my point is, let&#39;s respect a marriage, no matter where it is performed, because it is still something God sanctioned. My .02.<br />Mom"
