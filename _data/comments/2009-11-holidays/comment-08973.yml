text: "Actually, our vows never came from religion. As you may remember (and I know the ceremony was short so it was easy to forget) but there were NO references to the G or J words and the ceremony was performed by the Mayor of Oxford at a non-religious based location. What part of the bible did we followed in our CIVIL ceremony? We do not live our lives based on it nor was our marriage formed by it. So our marriage is not religious based and we are still very happy and life is good for us. We don&#39;t need people to pity us nor do we need people to pray for us. As for our emotional and financial state we are better together and never want to imagine life any other way. There is commitment to make it work, love for each other and trust in each other. It would be great if everyone could share have a life like we share and feel bad for those who cannot find such a relationship that gives them the ultimate in happiness (based on religion or NOT). Sorry but I had to put my 2 cents in on this one.<br />Tracy"
