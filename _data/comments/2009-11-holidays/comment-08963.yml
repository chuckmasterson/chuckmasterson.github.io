text: "As for the 80% stat, I did a little research on that the next day.  As it turns out I was right. I found some conclusions that I suspect she was trying to quote.  Here they are: Couples who cohabit prior to marriage are 80% more likely to end in divorce. (no mention of it happening within the first year). this is significantly different than what she had stated, but still equally preposterous.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about the conclusions drawn above is that they had no statistical evidence at all and did not reference any studies or statistics.<br /><br />For a more informed and statistically backed set of conclusions here you go:<br /><br />The CDC study found a difference of (9%) in the rate of divorce in the first ten years for spouses who cohabited before marriage compared to those who didn&#39;t. However, many other studies find that most or all of this link is explained by the differences between the kinds of people who cohabit and those who don&#39;t. Since most couples who marry today are already living together, those who don&#39;t are a more religious, conservative group with different divorce patterns. As sociologist Judith Seltzer wrote in a 2000 article in the Journal of Marriage and the Family, &quot;Claims that individuals who cohabit before marriage hurt their chances of a good marriage pay too little attention to this evidence.&quot;<br /><br />- The study did not demonstrate that cohabitation causes people to have a higher divorce rate. The two factors are correlated, but that doesn&#39;t mean that one necessarily caused the other. As CNN.com reported, &quot;One of the study&#39;s authors said the report did not draw the conclusion that living together before marriage was the cause of the relationship ending. &#39;It may not be the experience of cohabiting but the people who cohabit,&#39; said William Mosher. &#39;What we&#39;re saying about that is that we think that couples who cohabit before marriage may have different values than couples who do not,&quot; he said.&#39;&quot;<br /><br />- The researchers found much larger differences in divorce rates for other factors they considered. While there was a 9% difference in the ten-year divorce rate between couples who cohabited and those who didn&#39;t, the difference was 30% by family income (couples with an income of $50,000 or more are much less likely to get divorced), 24% by age at marriage (women who marry when they&#39;re 25 or older are less likely to divorce), 14% by religion (religious women are less likely to divorce), and 13% by education (women with education beyond high school are less likely to divorce).<br /><br />See the report here: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_23/sr23_022.pdf<br /><br />Everyone in my family knows that when someone tries to feed something to me that I find simply preposterous, I will always call “bullshit”."
