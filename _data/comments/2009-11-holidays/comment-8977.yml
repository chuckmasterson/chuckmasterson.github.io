text: "Not gonna happen. Marriage has been around since prehistoric times, and exists in all societies in the world that I know of. It&#39;s been defined in many different ways, but it&#39;s been a constant. Marriage is here to stay.<br /><br />Your whole point in the idea of separating marriage into religious and nonreligious varieties was to avoid disenfranchising Christians who want it defined in a certain way. But no matter what, you&#39;re disenfranchising someoneâ€”be it the gay Christians or the conservative, family-values Christians. There are peeple ryte now who are disenfranchised, such as polygamists. The problem won&#39;t be fixed by a redefinition, because it doesn&#39;t have any single solution. Peeple just have to lern to deal with that fact."
