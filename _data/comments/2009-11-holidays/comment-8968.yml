text: "I hope in all your arguing you two sons of mine will recognize that your parents are in a formal religion-free marriage but we have limitless love for each other and for you and the other kids and the grandkids and all.  A successful marriage comes from love and  commitment, whether it be religious or from some other source.  I know a lot of Christian marriages that have failed, and non-religious ones that haven&#39;t.  But if religion is important to the couple involved, I&#39;m all for it.  At least, if they share the same one and not like my parents, one Christian and one non-Christian.  Which brings the question, was their marriage a success even though they disagreed about all things religious?  They loved each other more than any other two people I know.  <br /><br />By the way, I&#39;m going to try to bake some of those gingerbread men.  Grandma"
