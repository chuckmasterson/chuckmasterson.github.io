text: "Christian gays would have a legal civil union sanctioned by the state. They would not be allowed a christian marriage.<br /><br />I realize that this arguement is all in generality, but I did premise the whole thing as a theory.<br /><br />My final theory, or more to the point, prediction is that in 50 years people who are married whether civil or sanctioned by some religion will be looked down on as being &quot;quaint&quot; and naive as to the ways of the modern world.<br /><br />The bean counters will have a provable formula that shows that without marriage and the associated costs, you are far better off financially to not get married. The breakdown will probably be 30% do better to stay married, probably a realistic marriage rate in 50 years, and 60% will lose large amounts of money. The remaining 10% will be a wash.<br /><br />Once you have one or two generations of people who can show that their starter marriage, which they opted to cohabitate instead of, would have been a disaster to go through with. It will become ingrained in suceeding generations.<br /><br />There will still be a vocal minority like you guys who make it work with old fashioned values, and the christians who will show some success, but the majority will be happily unmarried, unstigmatized, and guilt free.<br /><br />Dave"
