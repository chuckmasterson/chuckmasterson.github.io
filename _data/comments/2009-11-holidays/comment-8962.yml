Hope he enjoyed it.  Since you are excited about Christmas coming, I guess I&#39;d better get over my Scrooge mood and start decorating the house for it.  <br />Good for you to try to eliminate the ough in English.  Only a person who went to the National Spelling Bee would have enough authority to get away with it.  Oh, and do you want me to bake ginger cookies for Christmas, and if so do you want them gingerbread cut-out cookies with decorations on them, instead of gingersnaps?  I think the little kids prefer the ones with frosting and colored sugar on them.  Grandma"
