text: "No no no, that&#39;s not how to spell any of those words. There&#39;s a system to this, which I can detail if anyone&#39;s interested. But I won&#39;t right now, because I don&#39;t know if anyone is.<br /><br />Also, I thought of another thing to put on my Christmas list: <br />â€”A calendar, the kind with a page for each month with a nice picture. (I&#39;m through with the 365 Stupidest Things Ever Said calendars. Either they used to be way funnier or my sense of humor used to be much easier to please.)"
