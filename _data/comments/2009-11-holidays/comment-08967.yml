text: "This one’s mostly at Dave.<br /><br />I was going to reserve the smackdown for later, but I ended up getting into this one a bit so here goes.  Check your feelings before the next paragraph, because this might hurt, but I don’t intend for it to be mean, it’s just my emotion pushing through. Well, that and Jesus wasn’t able to stop me, hehe. You’re still my bro, yo.<br /><br />Since when is love founded in religion? What about marriage?<br /><br />Christians point to Adam and Eve as the origin of marriage. What a load. I mean seriously?! Only Christians try to claim marriage as theirs.  In fact marriage dates back, at a minimum, 5000 years according to most historians.  At that time, Christianity wasn’t even a twinkle in the eye of some dude named Adam, not to mention Lilith. The Chinese have been practicing marriage for nearly 2500 years. How would they come up with such a union without Christianity? Just ridiculous. Get your head out of the bible and back into reality.  I don’t mean to be mean, but honestly, don’t spout off crap from your religion without doing some research first.<br /><br />As for marriage being rooted by Christianity in the USA… Well duh. You and I came from areas of the world that had roots in Christianity. Ask any Native American, Aztec, Inca or Mayan what they believe, or what their belief on the origin of marriage is.  Yeah, I won’t even bother exploring that thought further because it’s not necessary for obvious reasons.<br /><br />As for the upside to unreligious marriage being nonexistent.  I wonder if Cammy feels that way right now? The smiles she shines on us is simply nirvana.  Pessimism has formed your way of thought and that is unfortunate. You appear to fail to see the good in life, love and happiness in the absence of Jesus. Tracy, Cammy and I are living proof that these all exist without a life of devotion to hokus pokus.<br /><br />Here’s another thought… there are many many species of animals that stay with one partner throughout their lives, and I suspect they know nothing of your Christianity.  Apparently their union means something to them.<br /><br />Btw, you are on your second marriage, so is Kim, and you didn’t live together prior to marriage, your likelihood of divorce statistically speaking is around 60%, Tracy and I lived together for over 3 years prior to our nuptials and our statistical chances of divorce are probably under 40%. But I’m pulling for ya!<br /><br />I’m sorry, that was a bit harsh.  I should feel ashamed… I guess I’ll have to wait for the pearly gates to find out if I was too harsh.<br /><br />Nate, if the religious want to take “marriage” and tuck it away in the bible, it’s fine with me. It’s just a word. True unions, lasting ones, are built on love and trust, not the imagination of some monks thousands of years ago, not to mention Webster."
