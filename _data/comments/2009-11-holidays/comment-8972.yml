text: "No offense taken Dan.<br /><br />I think you misunderstand me. This is a matter of semantics. Why don&#39;t you secular humanist/atheists keep the term marriage. I don&#39;t dispute that marriage as a contract has value. Marriage as a biblical concept has value to me as it is outlined in the bible. You don&#39;t believe in the bible, so really why take vows that most often come out of the bible. That makes most people hypocrits. If you don&#39;t believe in christianity, why take vows or follow a biblical marriage(or pretend to do so).<br /><br />Whatever you call either, I think they should be separated. I also stand by my belief that for most, but not all people, it is a contract that should not be entered into. Most have no idea what they are getting into. If it is just a contract, they should get advice on the downsides, custody battles, money problems, etc.<br /><br />For most people, they would be better off emotionally, financially, legally to NOT get married.<br /><br />Dave"
