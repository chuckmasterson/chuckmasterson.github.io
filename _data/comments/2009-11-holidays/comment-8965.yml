text: "In regards to the divorce thing....<br /><br />Not arguing your statistics at all, but I have a theory.<br /><br />I believe that marriage is of no value, or to say it better, adds no value to a union of people, unless it has some religious meaning for the people involved.<br /><br />Marriage is really rooted in Christianity in our culture in the USA. The stigma of co-habitating, or having kids out of wedlock in our mainstream culture has disappeared.<br /><br /><br />The upside is almost none, unless you are christian, or some other religion. The downside is divorce, lawyers, money fighting, custody battles, etc.<br /><br />I think marriage should be taken out of law and sent back to where it began, in the church, it has no place in the secular world, never really did. <br /><br />Separation of church and state.<br /><br />My 2 cents<br /><br />Dave"
