  One downfall of Staticman is that the spam filtering feature hasn't been fully
  developed. Spammers, for some reason, started heavily bombarding this post. So
  I'm locking comments, but you can still leave one via the [manual comment
  form](/manual-comment). You should copy-paste the address of this page first.
