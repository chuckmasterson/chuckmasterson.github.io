She has a girl also named Sierra so now they are Sierra and SierraOne. SierraOne is Kim's daughter. Kim also has 3 boys ages 18, 19, and 20. I have met Sierra1 but not the boys yet. The Sierras get along well. Sierra1 is actually in the process of being adopted. They are cute and even look a little alike."
