text: "Those who pick up hitchhikers are just as afraid of us as we are of them. Anyone who picks me up as a hitchhiker first has to believe that I&#39;m not going to harm them, which means they&#39;re probably someone who trusts and expects to be trusted. You could also argue that someone who picks me up may be the kind of nutjob who just wants to kill someone and they don&#39;t care if that person has a big beard and looks possibly crazy like me, but those kinds of nutjobs are figments of your imagination, and the media&#39;s. They just don&#39;t happen. How many people have you heard of who have gotten maimed by someone who picked them up? Remember my acquaintance from NYC who went on tour with his folk music guitar using only Greyhound and hitchhiking. He got upwards of twenty rides and not one person was even crazy enough to remark on when I asked.<br /><br />You keep trying to throw money at my cheap eccentricities to make them go away. &quot;I&#39;ll buy you an Amtrak ticket. Please stay off the freights.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll pay for you to stay an extra semester in college. Don&#39;t hop trains this fall.&quot; &quot;I&#39;ll send you money for food. You don&#39;t need to dumpster dive.&quot; Keep your money and let me be a weirdo."
