text: "I was going to try to come up with an ending to that story, but I&#39;ll do that later. Just got off a great trip, but I&#39;m definitely looking forward to Crowduck. Not only that, but I&#39;m looking forward to a piece of NÃ¸rske Nook pie, and being able to walk around freely without close-toed shoes on every minute. You may laugh, but it really is a cramp on my style. Unfortunately I didn&#39;t bring my krokay set with me to camp. If someone reading this saw fit to bring their set up, though, we could have some games. Oh, I&#39;m also looking forward to picking blueberries and kicking all your butts in poker. And I just may well get up early enough to cook breakfast, since they&#39;ve got us on a fairly early-riser type of schedule here - breakfast at 7:30, lights-out at 10. <br /><br />Dave - what in this post made you say Grinnell was right for me? Are you saying that because I probably wouldn&#39;t have gotten hooked up with Manito-wish if I&#39;d gone to Miami?<br /><br />See you in Duluth on the 15th, Grandma and Grandpa. I&#39;ll be getting off of trail that morning, and leaving as soon as I&#39;m back on land. I&#39;ll call you around the time I leave. Perhaps I&#39;ll catch a matinee of the new Harry Potter movie while I wait."
