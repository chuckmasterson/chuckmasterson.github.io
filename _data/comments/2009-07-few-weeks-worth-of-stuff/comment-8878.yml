text: "I used to make pasties when the kids were little.  It&#39;s a good way to use up leftover roast pork.  I know mine weren&#39;t authentic, as yours were, no doubt, but mine were darned good.  If you are interested, I&#39;ll show you how I made mine, and you can play around with different ingredients to suit your taste.  You&#39;d better eat them now, because they&#39;re pretty fattening, and someday you may have to watch your weight, but you sure don&#39;t now. Ha.  <br />We are getting things packed already.  Everyone around here is counting days.  I look forward to seeing you in Duluth.  Grandma"
