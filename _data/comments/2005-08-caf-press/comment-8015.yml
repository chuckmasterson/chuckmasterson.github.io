text: "It seems that Jim Vitello did sell clothing with the Caution! name at some point.  According to MarksFriggin.com he appeared on the Howard Stern show Tuesday August 17, 1999 with three samples and said that you could buy the scratch and sniff merchandise online or at Hot Topics or Spencer Gifts stores. Mark also mentions that Stern thought he was kind of odd, which I believe is saying something coming from Howard Stern. Evidently Jim said he \"was inspired to do this after visiting a strip club and getting a whiff of something nasty when a stripper got too close to him.\"  Doesn't sound like the most morally sound guy to me. Hot Topic and Spencers have no online record of selling the clothing anymore, which in part I'm sure is to the fact that he sued Hot Topic for $100,000(http://tinyurl.com/7j6sm).  I'm guessing this was either just a temporary guise to get him a copyright in order to sue others or his way to strike back after what he clearly thought was a brilliant idea, flopped.  Check out http://tinyurl.com/7lrcf for the press release he wrote that reads as though it was forced, embellished, and written entirely using a thesaurus.<br/><br/>http://tinyurl.com/d5gqm shows another case he filed against caution.com but thankfully lost.<br/><br/>I would be curious what would happen if you called the phone number he provides on the website. 626-331-1889 should be in Southern California.  If you've got 815,710,510,000 pounds of TNT to spare I think we can solve your problem altogether.  Maybe break California off the continental US once and for all while we're at it.<br/><br/>I think you could develop this into a newspaper article once school begins again.  Frivolous lawsuits seem to be a serious issue these days."
