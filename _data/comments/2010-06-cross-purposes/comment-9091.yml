text: "Outdoor wilderness school instructor. It has a nice ring to it. While you will find some of the disaffected yuppie types, you will still find some hardcore wilderness junkies. <br /><br />While you can learn lots in a school, necessity is the mother of invention. If you spent a spring/summer hiking the appalachian trail, you will have skills that range from late spring mountain snows, to early autumn mountain snows, and everything inbetween, covering quite a bit of latitude.<br /><br />I like the neighborhood thing. Now in burbland, most neighbors spend time determining how to keep your neighbors at bay. Things have changed and finding a REAL neighborhood is a treasure now.<br /><br />Dave"
