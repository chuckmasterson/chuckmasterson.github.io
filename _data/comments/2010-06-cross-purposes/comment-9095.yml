text: "Part two: <br /><br />I was confused and annoyed. They had given the counts for Joel (13), Dominique (15) and Johann (17), and to try and figure this out, I went up and asked what my count was. &quot;Thirteen,&quot; said Jen. &quot;Oh, tied with Joel, then?&quot; I asked. Jen and the shiny-headed man shuffled around and looked over the scoresheet. &quot;Oh!&quot; they said. It turned out they had confused me with Joel. I was the rightful third-place winner. Yeah! Score one for me and score another for asking questions!<br /><br />After the bee, Jen offered to buy me a drink for the mix-up, but I told her I don&#39;t really drink much and not to worry about it. Then I stood around and talked with Johann and another speller, Tessa. Turned out Tessa has a sister who graduated Grinnell in 2000, and she herself worked at McNally&#39;s, the grocery store in town, for a month or so. That was pretty cool. We all got along well, and Johann, knowing he wasn&#39;t going to be able to finish off his prize of a $25 tab, bought us both drinks. Eventually Johann had to go because he had an early morning, and so we all walked to the subway together.<br /><br />One final note: on my way back, I got nice and disoriented by the subways, and ended up waiting about half an hour in a station with a busker playing the guitar. I snapped along with him. He wrote his own songs and seemed like the kind of guy who might know John Houx. I asked him. &quot;Yeah, I met John Houx a few years ago,&quot; he said. So that was cool too. New York can be a small place in some ways. (Another example: Michael, a guy who hangs around with Darwin&#39;s mom a lot, once knew the guy who founded the press I&#39;m working with, and he&#39;s good friends with Seth Tobocman, the author we published who had a release party that I went to after my first day working there. That&#39;s the Lower East Side for you, I guess.)"
