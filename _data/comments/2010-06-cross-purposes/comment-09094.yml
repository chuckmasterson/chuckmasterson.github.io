text: "I prefer to think of it as Central America.<br /><br />I just had a first. Blogger told me I wrote too much for a blog comment, so I&#39;ll have to split it in two.<br /><br />Part one:<br /><br /><br />Oh yeah, the spelling bee! <br /><br />I found out about it from the internet, scant days before it happened, and immediately I planned on going to it. It&#39;s a bit different from my previous spelling bee, in that it&#39;s held inside a little bar. The bar is called Pete&#39;s Candy Store, but I sure didn&#39;t see any candy there. After a little while of standing around awkwardly and not knowing what to do and not knowing I was supposed to tip the bartender because it was my first time going to a bar and being able to get a drink, I went to the little back room where there&#39;s a stage and chairs and such. Near the sign-up sheet there was an intimidating-looking shiny-headed bald man in a three-piece suit, but I signed up as contestant 13 of 18 spots available, and sat down with a beer and waited for the bee to begin.<br /><br />Since it&#39;s open to just anyone who wants to spell words, there were some people who weren&#39;t very good. The bar had changed the rules a bit to give these people at least half a chance to have fun, by giving everyone three strikes before they were out. One guy who was sitting next to me spelled <i>laity</i> LAITIY. He just kind of crashed and burned on the end, and he knew it. The first round was one word, the second was two back-to-back, and the third was three; in the fourth round people just spelled words until they exhausted their strikes. For my first round I spelled <i>corrodible</i>... I spelled it -ABLE. What a dirty-tricky word. I was pretty happy about having three strikes. I came back and spelled some words correctly, though I don&#39;t remember most of them now. There was <i>spinnaker</i> and... actually, that&#39;s all I can remember right now, except for one other word I got wrong, which was <i>parure</i>, a fashionable kind of jewelry that comes in a pair. (I went with PARREUR. I think it was a  more solid misspelling than MARATE was.) Jen, the host, and Eric, her shiny-headed co-host, gave the words a little differently than they do at the national bee. Mainly there was a lot more swearing and sexual innuendo. One of the words&#39; definitions got a &quot;That&#39;s what she said&quot; from someone. This wouldn&#39;t fly with Jacques Bailly, but it was perfect here, where people were in the mood not just for spelling words, but also for getting slightly tipsy.<br /><br />I was the first person to have a really good run of rightly-spelled words. But there were two other people who had a lot in store. Johann (who, counterintuitively, is actually Chinese) came first and just would not stop effing spelling. He got out eventually and I told him, &quot;I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s you or me!&quot; I hadn&#39;t been keeping track very well. And then there was Dominique, who worried me too, although I knew I had at least 3rd place in the bag, since only Johann had spelled anywhere close to as many as I had, and Dominique was #18.<br /><br />After she struck out, they took a moment to tally up the places. In third, Joel! Joel was a pretty cool guy I had sat near. I couldn&#39;t understand how he had third, though, because he got out about three words into round 4. But anyhow. In second, Dominique! So did that mean I had beat Johann and Dominique and Joel both had too? Huh? And in first place, Johann!"
