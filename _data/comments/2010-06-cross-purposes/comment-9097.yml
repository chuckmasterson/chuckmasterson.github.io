text: "It couldn&#39;t happen twice--a tricky French word.  I guess you don&#39;t remember the story by Guy de Maupassant called The Necklace.  No doubt you had to read it in some long ago English class.  Well, that story in French is La Parure.  If you&#39;d been in my fourth year French class you&#39;d have read it in the original French.  It&#39;s one of the best short stories ever written, I&#39;d say.<br /><br />Anyway, good luck on the final, and I sure hope you have a lot of fun with it, because it sure sounds like your kind of place and people.
