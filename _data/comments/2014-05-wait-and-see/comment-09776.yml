text: "WISDOM.<br /><br />You can only peer down the Road Not Taken so far.  Eventually you deal with the road you do take, no matter how it winds around, even if it goes back to the starting point.<br /><br />I know we&#39;ve missed something by never living around our family, but our lives have been filled with adventures I wouldn&#39;t have want to miss.  You eventually learn to accept each day as it comes, and wherever you are, you&#39;ll maximize your choices.  You only get to pass this way once.  Make the most of it to enjoy each day, and the rest will fall into place.  <br /><br />Aunt E.  (Sharing both your family and your Grinnell backgrounds!)<br /><br /><br />"
