text: "I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to go away to live without being nostalgic for your childhood home.  That&#39;s just so normal.  But when your instincts are saying that you need to try something different for a while, that&#39;s good.  You&#39;ve got so much time to try both, if that&#39;s what you eventually decide you&#39;ll do.<br /><br />When you&#39;re old you&#39;ll look back on your choice, whichever it is, and say that that really changed everything.  Just think.  If Grandpa hadn&#39;t gotten an offer to teach at Miami, and had stayed in Iowa, you wouldn&#39;t even exist, since your parents would never have met.<br /><br />Either way, it&#39;s all good.  Miss you and love you to pieces, and I&#39;m waiting for your mother to show up.  We&#39;re having a paleo-ish dinner of barbecued ribs, broccoflower, and salad.  I also have rhubarb crisp, which isn&#39;t paleo because it&#39;s made with flour and sugar.  Oh well.  <br /><br />Best of luck with your new job, and keep us in the loop.  Grandma"
