text: "Take it from someone whose next birthday will put me into the \"Last Hurrah Decade\"--the only way NOT to feel pessimistic when you get there is to have lived the life you wanted and to have done the things you really wanted to and needed to do.  So, since you have all that great time ahead of you, don't waste a minute of it, because it just goes faster and faster like a rocket blasting to the moon.  Before you turn around you will be looking back at most of it.  And while I'm lecturing you, let's hope you don't really go riding a bike and have a bad accident.  Be careful!  Grandma"
