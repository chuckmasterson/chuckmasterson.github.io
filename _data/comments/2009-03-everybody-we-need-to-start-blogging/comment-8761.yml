text: "I hadn't considered the environmental ramifications of mercury before - I know there was mercury, but I only thought about it to think, \"Don't break these bulbs.\" I looked up the problem on Wikipedia, and they say it's not so big a problem.<br/>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_fluorescent_lamp#Mercury_Emissions<br/>Apparently, if your electricity comes from coal, the electricity you save actually offsets the amount of mercury you put in the environment later. If you don't live in a coal area, it's not a whole lot of mercury, although it's definitely true that it is some.<br/>Also, coal provides about 50% of the electricity consumed in America, which itself is a scary statistic."
