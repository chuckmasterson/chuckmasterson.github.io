text: "I bet one thing they will make you do in the Ecohouse is to close and latch your windows in the winter months.  I know you need to be taught this because I had to close and latch the windows in your bedroom at home while I was measuring for the new ones you'll be getting in a week or so. So plant that in your garden and grow it Mr. Green Jeans!  Incidentally, if the weather holds out without raining for 4 or 5 more days, I will be tilling and planting my garden.  Maybe you can come up here and I'll put you to work in trade for teaching you some tricks of the trade."
