text: "One of the big \"green\" eco jokes is the flourescent lightbulbs. Each one of those things is loaded with Mercury. If one happens to shatter on your carpet, you have a small be real little toxic mess. If you read the labels, they are supposed to be disposed of as any other toxic material, such as car batteries.<br/><br/>In 20 years the Eco junkies will be lamenting the spread of toxic mercury. They do save energy, but I am not sure it is worth the cost.<br/><br/>Dave"
