text: "I can understand your frustration about freight trains.  The actual reason is that the railroad companies own the railroads outright.  They lease the tracks to Amtrack per trip (as well as other railroad companies).  So, Amtrack is at their mercy.<br/><br/>It is important to realize that Railroads are THE ONLY form of transportation NOT subsidized by the government.  Airports, roads, Shipping canals & docks, are all heavily subsidized.  Why should the railroads cater to Amtrack?  If Truckers had to pay for their own roads, they wouldn’t be able to, and we’d have one hell of a railroad system (again) in America.  It’s a shame.<br/><br/>Dan"
