text: "You bring back such memories.  I used to take the train to and from college, and the train went through Grinnell.  Sometimes Ellen was with me as far as Grinnell.  And I did what you did one time, when I was thinking about going to Wittenberg College.  I rode the train to Chicago, changed stations, got on another train, rode all night to Cincinnati, then took a train to Springfield.  It was exhausting.  It's a good thing I didn't like doing that, because if I'd chosen Wittenberg I wouldn't have met Grandpa so there wouldn't have been an Ann and therefore there never would have been a Nathanael!
