text: "It really does look so good, doesn&#39;t it? After I wrote this I found a great blog (<a href=\"http://chuckmasterson.blogspot.com/www.shinshine.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">www.shinshine.com</a>) by a Korean living in America about how to cook a bunch of obscure things that I never saw on the more popular Korean cooking blogs. Building on what I&#39;ve learned from that blog, I&#39;m going to try to work my way through everything in the market, probably even all the nameless roots. I just had the naeng&#39;i soup yesterday and it was pretty darn tasty."
