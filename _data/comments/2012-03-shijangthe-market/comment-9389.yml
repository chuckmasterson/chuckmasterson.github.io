text: "I LOVE your market pictures.  We&#39;ve traveled the world over and have seen many markets like this.  But we haven&#39;t lived there and been able to shop to buy food to prepare ourselves.  Grandpa is right.  We are in awe of your experiences there, and more to the point, your endless optimism and curiosity along with respect for your environment.  People like you will save the world.  Grandma"
