text: "Looks like some good stuff. Someone once explained to me the secret of Indian cooking. It is passed on generation to generation more as a way of life than anything else. In the western world cooking is a means to an end, and all tradition got swallowed up at Burger King. It is not something you can just learn from a book. It looks like Korean culture is the same way. Perhaps you&#39;ll be invited to spend a day in a traditional Korean household and you may be exposed to it in a more tangible way. Somehow I picture an exasperated Grandmother trying to pass the family ways to the new generation shaking her head in disgust!<br /><br />Dave"
