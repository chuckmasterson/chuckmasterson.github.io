text: "Your life rocks as usual. A veritable frog throwing good time. Maybe we could kidnap you for a few days and steer you northwest for a krokay game at camp.<br/><br/>On a side note, since the movie, the \"Bus\" has become somewhat of a shrine from some things I have read. Someone even stole the instrument cluster from the front of the bus and sold it on E-Bay. Somehow there is alot of Irony in that. The one place he went to escape the modern world, and through legend it still finds him and the all elusive chase for a buck.<br/><br/>What a shame....<br/><br/>Dave"
