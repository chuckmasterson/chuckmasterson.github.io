text: "I'll miss Crowduck too. Quite a bit. But, assuming we go next year, I'm pretty confident I'll be along. And I'm going to play krokay at least once with all of you people this summer. Probably after camp, since I leave this weekend. But if we can arrange a date sometime this week, I'm eager for that. Are Grandma and Grandpa in town?"
