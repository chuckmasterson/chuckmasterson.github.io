text: "Kitesurfing requires extremely strong hands in order to not fall off the kite bar.  I suggest you find a job in a dairy, in Iowa, when you get there, in which they only milk cows by hand - the old fashioned, non-mechanical, organic way.  After 6 months to a year you will have strong enough hands to surf (fly) long distances.  By the way where does one buy one of these things, it might be fun to try at Crow Duck.  GPa"
