text: "I love you, your krokay set, your brain, your soul, your fonts, your clicking, your humor, your funny videos you show me, your love for me and everyone in your life, your appreciation of nature and concern for our earth, your biking, your long hair, your fuzzy face, your beautiful expressive eyes, and everything else about you, and will forever and ever and ever. And as much as I love you, God even loves you more, and that much I KNOW is true, and having you and being your mother has been one of the most beautiful things God has ever done for me, and I am thankful He gave me to you and you to me.  <br/><br/>Mom"
