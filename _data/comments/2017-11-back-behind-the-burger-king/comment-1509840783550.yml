  Yeah, maybe it's to do with how everyone seems to have a sense that the world
  is crumbling... if you think it's the end of the world, it can feel like
  *everything* is serious. Although it may just be that a lot of people from the
  US have a massive ego about their country, and anything that threatens to make
  that ego look less justified is Not Okay and makes them panic.
