text: "[Haiku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku) is a Japanese type of poem. (And since it's a Japanese word, and Japanese doesn't have a plural-singular distinction, *haiku* is both the plural and the singular.) Wikipedia will tell you a lot about the many different criteria a poem has to satisfy before it's considered a haiku. Well, in the US, what most people can remember is that it's:\r\n\r\n5 syllables  \r\n7 syllables  \r\n5 syllables\r\n{: .poetry .text-center }\r\n\r\nSome people also remember that there's something about the season in it. Mine don't follow the syllable scheme exactly, but I'm calling that “poetic license” (that's a handy English phrase, which people use to get away with a lot of not-quite-following-the-rules). I think I did mention something specific to the season in all of them. I think I failed to use a \"cutting word\", which I'm told is essential, so maybe I didn't actually write haiku... or maybe I wrote some with poetic license.\r\n\r\nI did get your letter, by the way. It got busted open along the way, but I think everything was still in it. Haven't had a chance to write anything back yet, though. Also I couldn't figure out the card with the statue of King Sejong. Why does the ink scratch off? I couldn't understand what was happening in the little picture you included."
