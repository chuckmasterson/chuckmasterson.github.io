  thanks for your brief explanation about haiku. But in US, haiku is a popular
  form of poem? Oh i just knew this. And HAIKU ALONG THE WAY..this is brilliant.
  lol. Language is flexible as long as understable. Btw the card of King Sejong,
  actually, it was a scratch post card set. Did you find the wood stick as well?
  You need to scracth it following the line. And the picture was the cherry
  blossom flowers that I took in ewha and printed in sticker paper.
