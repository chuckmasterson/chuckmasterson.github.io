text: "Don't mistake my prediction for paradigm shifting change as a sign of wanting to run and hide, or be negative. Change is GOOD, and it always comes. We americans cling to our money, security, materialism, and wrap it in ignorance and apathy.<br/><br/>Of cousre this is a big generalization of things, but I sense that BIG changes are in store for this country for the next 100 years. The ones who can adapt and see beauty in a rebirth of what America is, will flourish. The ones who feel mad that all they are \"entitled\" to in this post WWII, we are kings of the world world, is being taken away will not do so well.<br/><br/>What America and most of the western world has promised to it's people as a right and an entitlement cannot sustain. We all feel sad that the WWII economic bonanza won't last forever, but seeing that it will change is a positive thing for me. I like to be around people who see and chase dreams that are real and grounded in a future reality, and alot of the people (most to be sure) don't see what really matters.<br/><br/>Change is GOOD! Clinging to the past and listenting to poisoned polarizing politicians is bad.<br/><br/>Dave"
