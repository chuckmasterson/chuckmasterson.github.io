text: "That's the thing. If we're already on the \"negative doomsday train\", we can't help but keep going to the end of the line, and we might as well enjoy ourselves as much as we can on our way and after we get there. If we're not on the train, well then I'm still going to enjoy everything, it's just there won't be any of this sad stuff going on around me, so I'll be enjoying it even more.<br/>Maybe it's true that one in a million or a billion people can make a serious social change, but ony if they're really lucky. I'm not that interested in swaying the inert masses, though if I become an author that will be a minor goal of my prose. <br/>Who said anything about living in caves? I never mentioned them at all, except when we took our Kentucky vacation. Never fear; I won't go live in a cave and then insist that you play krokay in my house. If that's what you were afraid of."
