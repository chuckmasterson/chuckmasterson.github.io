text: "\"The full glass is full of holes\": This is absolutely excellent. I love this phrase on several different levels. <br/>Unfortunately, in the case of a total economic collapse, I doubt if the trains would still be running for long. But, all sorts of other things would happen that we simply don't get the opportunity to see today. The collapse would have lots of terrible aspects, and result in a lot of death. I would definitely be saddened heavily by it; probably I would cry quite a few times, and I never cry. But we could also turn to some of the new life that sprung up in its wake: prairies regenerating, forests expanding, nature recovering. I have no idea what might lay in store, nor do I think anyone really does, because there are so many chaotic variables. But there would be bad and good in it. How much we get of each would depend on how we'd prepared up until then.<br/><br/>In a side note, I don't know if I've ever written a whole paragraph in the conditional mood before."
