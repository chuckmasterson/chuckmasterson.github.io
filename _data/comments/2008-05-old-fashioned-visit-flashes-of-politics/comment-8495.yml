text: "I want to try very hard not to come off as a nut. I'm not a conspiracy theorist. I realize that the government isn't interested in me particularly, and that they're not a group of hostile people planning on making America a totalitarian state. They're for the most part probably pretty good people (though, there have certainly been quite a few crazies). They want their liberties too. I don't knowa whole lot about the government, but it seems likely that Congress probably doesn't pass laws that its members themselves wouldn't want to be subject to - or at least not often. The crux, though, is that they've been getting a little less reasonable of late, with the PATRIOT Act and the REAL ID Act. Notice that both of these acts have played on fear of terrorism. The threat of getting hit with an airplane if you don't relinquish a few liberties seems to have given Congress a much freer reign on what they can pass. If it combats terrorism, it'll probably get passed. And that's been giving the government, which is to a certain point detached from the populace at large, powers that it shouldn't have. Do you agree that wire taps shouldn't need warrants? I doubt it. It seems like a pretty minor issue, especially since you're not personally going to get tapped. But it's still a violation of rights, an intrusion. Ditto for the REAL ID. It seems pretty minor, but you justify it by saying it'll have no effect on you personally. It'll only be young Arab men. The REAL ID has much more potential for spreading out to affect a big chunk of the population than the phone tapping thing does, since it requires much less effort. What will happen will be comparatively less dramatic, but nonetheless a retraction of a privacy you once had. The REAL ID is especially more worrying because it has the potential to be used by more people than just the government, and since it gathers all sorts of information that could be given to other parties, instead of a small amount of information that's probably pretty useless if it doesn't actually implicate you as a terrorist. Only the government will have access to the databases of the REAL ID system. That's at least how it will start out. I think it's reasonable to expect they'll start sharing information with potential creditors. Then that dam will be boken, and maybe they'll decide it's not so bad to share your information with amazon.com. The specific information shared won't be much at first either, but slowly and surely all these information-age easy data sharing techniques will get used more and more. I don't find that a comforting thought, and I plan to take no part in it, even though it appears pretty tolerable. I also have to wonder what the next act passed will be. The government tends to be imaginative in these things. It could end up being even less tolerable. <br/>But even if none of this comes to fruition - even if they take securities back to the pre-9/11 standards - I still have that other problem with not being in charge of my own life. That one he government can't solve, nor can anything in civilization, because civilization itself is the fundamental thing holding me back from it."
