text: "Aha!  I found all John Christopher's books at Amazon.  The one I was thinking of is called Empty World, 1977.  I'm tempted to send for a used copy.  The Roman story is a series of three books called Fireball, 1981, New Found Land, 1983, and Dragon Dance, 1986.  I remember now that the second one in that series was about the kids coming to America, only it had never been discovered, except by the Vikings, and the third book was something to do with the Aztecs, who also had survived to the present because the conquerers had never come.  <br/><br/>I might just have to send for these, too.  Hmmm.<br/><br/>Irene"
