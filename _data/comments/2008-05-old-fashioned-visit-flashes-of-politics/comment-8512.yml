text: "Oh, darn, I just can't remember the name of the book.  I don't even know if it's available any more.  John Christopher was popular when I was teaching in an elementary school, and his trilogy about the Tripods was on the sixth grade novel list.  It's not in the library any more, but they did recently republish that set.  Anyway, I read some of his other things because he had a really interesting view of existence.  I was fascinated by the one where the kids go through a time warp and find themselves in an alternate world where Rome never fell.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure of the trouble I was having, but I think probably I typed in the security word wrong, and then closed the file thinking I had gone through.  It's probably okay now that I know what to watch for.  <br/><br/>I'm going to try looking up John Christopher and see if I can find the name of the book for you.<br/><br/>Irene<br/><br/>P.S. Yeah, I was really interested in the Armageddon story set in Australia.  Nuclear disaster, that time.  What was it, \"On the Beach\"?"
