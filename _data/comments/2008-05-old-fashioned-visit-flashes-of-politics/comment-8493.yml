text: "If Real ID goes into effect, at least it won't affect you until 2014. So you have ample time to secede. But if you secede, don't disappear. You'll drive your mom crazy. The best thing- know how to hunt, gather, etc. if you have to... I think this is the basic thing the Amish do- live in self-sufficient groups and will not have anything to do with something they have to rely on others to provide. If they can produce it themselves, they will. <br/><br/>Now there are lots of people who let these thoughts get away from them and so they make bunkers, stockpiles, etc. and so they are prepared \"just in case\"- and that is fine and one can do that. One can be able to hunt. Your dad can teach you how to hunt. If the entire economy collapsed today we could go to Nana and Papa's and as a unit we'd be pretty successful. I think in some military trainings, they teach you these things also. But if the whole economy collapses, you can be with your family.<br/>You know I have thought out exactly the same scenario a million times in my head. But please don't let it get you paranoid. Participate in stuff around you.<br/><br/>Personally if everyone knew my purchase history, salary, etc. I guess I would no longer care. I don't have much to hide and I don't think the government is very interested in me. I'm old enough now that I have realized that. Being in some pan-database, though, is probably not going to happen, or if it does, it won't be so efficient. Believe me when I say the government's computer systems are often outdated, lacking in interfaces (everything stands alone), some of it stored in a bunch of old boxes in a government warehouse. And say they, by some wild vicissitude, get did get that information. What would they need to know it for? And what good would it do? Believe me when I tell you there is no group of lordly overseers in the government- just a bunch of temporarily elected, agenda-driven officials who range in ability from inadequately to mildly competent. And the inner workings of the FBI and CIA are interested not in the musings of any single citizen. I think if you want to secede from the economy and kind of live a Grizzly Addams experience, I hope you have a few people around you because it will be difficult solo...because there are people who love you (like me). <br/>MOM"
