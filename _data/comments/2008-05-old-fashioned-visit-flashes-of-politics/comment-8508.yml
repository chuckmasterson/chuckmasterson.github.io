text: "Well, I have tried to leave a comment, but don't seem to be getting through.  Never mind.  I just suggested looking for a book by John Christopher, who writes science fiction for young adults.  It's about a doomsday of another kind, where a young boy is the sole survivor of a disease that wipes out all mankind, and how he eventually meets a couple of other survivors, and how terribly lonely it is for them all.<br/><br/>Love, Aunt Irene<br/><br/>I'm trying again."
