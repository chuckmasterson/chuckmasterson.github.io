text: "Not me! Not me!  I do not care to ride on your negative, doomsday train.  I much prefer the world of hope and optimism.  It is lighter, cleaner and the sun usually shines.  <br/><br/>If you don't like what you see, work to change it.  It really takes only one person to make real and I mean REAL change.  Look at Gandhi, MLK, Abe, Jesus, Moses, Churchill.   Jumping off the train and living in your cave makes absolutely zero contribution to anything, especially the person who jumped off the train. <br/><br/>Enjoy life, don't hide from it.  Be and optimistic activist and never be a hide in the cave, pessimist (no one will care or pat attention to you)..     Live life to the fullest and never ever hide.   Life should be fun and full of Krokay (I refuse to play Krokay in a cave).....Grandpa"
