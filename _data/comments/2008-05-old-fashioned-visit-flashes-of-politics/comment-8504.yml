text: "Actually those Kentucky caves were really nice and I could live in one for a while...'slong as I had plenty of walls to make murals on. <br/><br/>I have imagined all kinds of scenarios (what if all electricity somehow stopped functioning? what if there were a nuclear attack? what if, what if....?)  I really HAVE thought those through. As a new mom especially, that instinct really kicked in. I mean I mentally mapped out routes to walk/run if I were at work and a big earthquake happened- routes to go to get back to my kids. I have had the thought a zillion times about the I Am Legend scenario, too, and how I would break in and get my meds from existing drugstores before others could- but I didn't dwell on those thoughts all the time. <br/><br/>When 911 happened, Nathanael, your dad actually planned out sending you two to West Virginia for a while, anticipating nuclear attacks on cities, and thinking about Wright Pat so close made him nervous. Kind of the like the kids of Narnia (that was a real situation for so many kids in WWII)...anyway...it was just a backup to backup plan. Sure you make these plans JUST IN CASE. But then you get pragmatic and deal with the situation as is as well.<br/><br/>There are going to be a lot of things that you just can't plan for, so just getting up in the morning we take our chances. <br/><br/>The one thing I do agree with Dave on is that we here are pretty pampered- Affluenza- when compared to the rest of the world, to whom economic collapse is a daily reality."
