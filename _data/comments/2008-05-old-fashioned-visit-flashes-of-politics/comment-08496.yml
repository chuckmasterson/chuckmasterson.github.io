text: "I just talked to your DAD. You may not realize it but he is pretty expert in survivalist skills. Imagine yourself with NOTHING, in the wilderness. How do you eat? Build shelter? Get water? Survive long-term? And then, DEFEND yourself against animals and other people who want your things?  (That's a big thing that has to be thought of- we all want to cooperate in such a scenaria, but realize that you will be fighting others because they will attack and you need to know how to fight and defend yourself, those you love, and your stuff from them).<br/><br/>When you are home this summer perhaps he can teach you all this stuff. You may not see that he knows this sometimes, but he does know it. He knows how to fletch arrows, keep up a gun in proper working order for a long time, hunt any type of game, make clothes from animal skins, and source edible vs. poison fruits and vegetables, and fashion tools. Bet you didn't know that about your old man. :)  I think once you have gone through some survivalist training,that can put your mind at ease. LOVE YOU much!!!!!! <br/><br/>I think it is very normal for a young man's instincts to be kicking in- whether at a university with blogs abounding or in a forest with a few tribemates and you are experiencing that awakening(btw modern humans have been around for about 100K years only -3 million years maybe since the first little unicellular critters).<br/><br/>MOM"
