text: "I think alot of what you are saying is spot on. I am a creature and creation of the modern luxury world, and I too see the eventual writing on the wall. This pampered, entitled, disenchanted world we live in, is a one trick self absorbed pony, waiting to be slaughered. Your generation feels it too. I see the apathy in kids today. We have more of \"it all\", all the time, yet the full glass is full of holes.<br/><br/>I for one believe that we will see in my lifetime, and yours an entire economic collapse. It won't end in a prmative \"Mad Max\" scenario, but for a time it could be REALLY bad.<br/><br/>I applaud you for seeing what is real and what is illusion of a soft and falling world.<br/><br/>You don't need to learn how to drive, you can be a freight train tramp.<br/><br/>Someday we could take a hike to the bus, wouldn't that be cool?<br/><br/>Dave"
