text: "Okay folks, I�ve waited long enough to comment.  I just wanted to see how far and deep this obstinate topic would go before slowing down to whimper.  Well, truthfully I just read this entry for the first time so here goes...<br/><br/>Grandpa makes the best comment.  Don�t run away.  Work hard to make real change and to facilitate organized action. No country was ever built by people shying away from adversity.<br/><br/>Now on to you bunch of doomsday duds.  Of course, we�ve all thought about what would happen if the real world war happens. I mean Duh! That goes without saying. If there�s anyone left that hasn�t realized yet that bombs and religion aren�t going to save the planet� it will be easy to figure out after the big war, because you all will be first to meet your peril.<br/><br/>The brighter side:  Necessity is the mother of invention. If there�s one thing humans can do, it�s invent themselves out of a jam.  It�s already started.  Who had ever heard of a Hybrid car 5 years ago? Now a show of hands, who knows someone that drives one?  I do, and I bet you do to. Who knows someone that has started combining trips to save gas this year? I do, and I bet you do to.  Who knows someone that 10 years ago could have voted but never cared enough to do so, and now votes? I do, and I bet you do to.  Who knows someone that used to think global warming doesn�t exist but admits it does now? I do, and I bet you do to.  Who knows someone that was really scared of terrorists after 911, but now is more afraid of their own government? I do, and I bet you do to.  Who knows someone that�s heard the saying �absolute power corrupts absolutely�?  I do, and I bet you do to.  Who knows someone that is optimistic instead of pessimistic and that believes that real change for the better is upon us? I do, and I bet you do to.<br/><br/>Live for today, act for tomorrow. Dance like nobody�s watching.<br/><br/>Dan"
