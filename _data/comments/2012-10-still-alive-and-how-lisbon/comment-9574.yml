text: "Well by now you are in Santiago de Compostela and perhaps even on your way elsewhere.  I hope it was all and more of what your hoped for.  Yesterday and today  we saw Cammy and Cory and parents.  They have boundless energy and I have severely bounded energy.  Oh well, better than no energy.  Weather has taken a turn toward the cool side.  We have a  hurricane slamming the east coast in what they are calling a Frankenstorm.  Supposed to be severe.  Let us know how your doing when you have time.  Tracy has posted a thank you on Facebook.  Grandpa"
