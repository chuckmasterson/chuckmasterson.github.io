text: "Oh, I already know that stuff. My flight from London gets into Chicago at 3:30pm on December 23. But I figure I&#39;ll take a Greyhound to get back home. No need to go all the way to Chicago.<br /><br />Quick update: I&#39;m currently in Redondela, Galicia, Spain, where I&#39;m sleeping on the second night of my walking pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela. I expect to reach the remains of St James on the 29th. Then I&#39;m not sure where to next. But for now, the Way of St James is incredible. Currently in the Redondela library with an Australian freegan who&#39;s been traveling Europe for something like two years. Good stuff!"
