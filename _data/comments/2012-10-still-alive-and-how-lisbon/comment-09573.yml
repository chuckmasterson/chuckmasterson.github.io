text: "Wow!  You must have gotten some good rides.  Hope you enjoyed rural Portugal on the way, and I also hope you stuffed your pockets with rolls and fruit when you went to breakfast that morning.  I&#39;m so glad Ramon had breakfast with you.  He said he was wiped out and would sleep for two days when he got home.<br />We had a tiring trip home with lots of airport running around.  But we&#39;re here and happy.  Have pictures for you when you get home.  And I hope you really enjoy looking at the cathedral, because it&#39;s Romanesque, and thus very, very old.  Grandma"
