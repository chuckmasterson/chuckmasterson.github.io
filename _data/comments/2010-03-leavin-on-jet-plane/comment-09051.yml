text: "You won&#39;t see this until you&#39;re back, but Happy Belated Birthday Greetings.  And I hope you both learned and had fun on your Costa Rica trip.  I am thinking of you and what a neat thing it is you are there.  But please, in the future, have a place for your passport and ALWAYS, but always, keep it there without fail.  Organization, for sure, or chaos.  It would have been a disaster for you to have not found it after all.  Anyway, best wishes for the rest of the term.  Grandma"
