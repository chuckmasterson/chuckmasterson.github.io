text: "It stinks to find out through being robbed that there are a whole lot of people out there who want only to take advantage of you, and have no respect for the property of others.  Not a very good scenario.  I hope you&#39;ll take better care for your security from now on, and I&#39;m glad you haven&#39;t been hurt or anything.  And I sure hope you can recover your photos.  What would a thief want with them, anyway?  Grandma"
