text: "No password, but I got my online passwords changed within a few hours anyhow. PayPal, Google, all that. I looked up ways to recover lost computers and it looks like I maybe shouldn&#39;t have been so hasty to change my Google password, because that&#39;s one website that would tell me what IP address the thief may have used the computer from. But regardless, from what I read, the odds for recovering a computer that way are pretty slim. You have to file something through the ISP, get a search warrant, and everything.<br /><br />I do have high hopes for recovering the photos. Even though my camera was right next to my computer, they didn&#39;t take it, so I still have the SD card that the photos all lived on. I deleted them a while back, but when computers delete something, they don&#39;t overwrite it with 0&#39;s, they just mark the space as available to overwrite when needed, so there are various file recovery programs that can look into supposedly empty space. You may yet get Giant Backlog of Photos II and more."
