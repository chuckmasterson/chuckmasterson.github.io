text: "Nope! True this is the longest gap it&#39;s had, as far as I know, but that&#39;s mostly because I had no computer for a month and then, when I got one, had to get it set up, and also suddenly found out that I had so much stuff to do that there was no time to blog. It shouldn&#39;t be long now. <br /><br />For example, it was going to be tricky to blog this weekend while I was at a cabin on Lake Vermilion in the far north of Minnesota accessible only by boat and with electricity only when we ran the generator at night."
