text: "On some computers, people in the know can track your computer whenever it is connected to the internet. People have retrieved their laptops when the police raid the location where their computer is tracked to.       Try contacting your computer manufacturer and/or seller. Also the police probably can tell you who can track it for you.    Uncle Chuck"
