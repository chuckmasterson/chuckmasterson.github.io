text: "It&#39;s to make English more phonetic. There are a lot of spellings in English that we hav only because they harken back to when words were pronounced completely different, and there&#39;s not really a good reason for us to keep those spellings today, except that that&#39;s the way dictionaries spell words. The best example is any word with &quot;gh&quot; in it. We no longer have that sound, but we still write it. But I&#39;ve decided not to. The same goes for tough-&gt;tuf and though-&gt;tho. (The reason &quot;right&quot; becomes &quot;ryte&quot; insted of &quot;rite&quot; is that &quot;rite&quot; is alredy a werd, and so are a lot of -ite werds, but there are very few -yte werds, and they&#39;re not ones that would be confused with respelled -ight words.) I also <br />• take out the pointless b&#39;s in det, dout, clyme, asf.; <br />• take out misleading a&#39;s in insted, redy, helth, erly...; <br />• respell strange things like flud, blud, bisy/bisness, werk...<br />• clarify werds that hav long vowels that aren&#39;t shown in the spelling, like moste, bothe, poste...<br />• get rid of silent e&#39;s at the end of werds that don&#39;t need them, like hav, liv, giv (which seem to be spelled that way because English doesn&#39;t like v&#39;s at the ends of werds—but I think they&#39;re fine),<br />• and whatever else strikes me as a good idea when I&#39;m writing.<br /><br />But I don&#39;t<br />• take out letters that distinguish two werds from each other, even when they&#39;re pointless—so, &quot;nyte&quot; and &quot;knyte&quot; are like that;<br />• respell &quot;often&quot; as &quot;offen&quot;, because even tho I pronounce it that way, a lot of other peeple don&#39;t, and I want my system to be as inclusiv as it can be;<br />• respell wr- as r-, because I think there are some peeple who still myte pronounce that r with a shade of w in it;<br />• take out the l in &quot;should&quot;, &quot;would&quot;, and &quot;could&quot;, because I couldn&#39;t figure out an unambiguous better way to spell them;<br />• obscure etymological relationships—so, even tho &quot;really&quot; is (usually) pronounced &quot;rilly&quot;, I don&#39;t spell it that way because that would break its connection with &quot;real&quot;.<br /><br />It&#39;s still a werk in progress, and you&#39;ll probably often catch me spelling a werd two different ways, or more. But I&#39;v got it mostely figured out, since I&#39;v ben using it in my journal for so long. It&#39;s the system I&#39;v ben using in the book I&#39;m writing. If I ever get it (or something else) published, I can become known not only as an author, but as the author with the weird spellings. I guess I would probably include an author&#39;s note that&#39;s something like this.<br /><br />So, that&#39;s what&#39;s up with that."
