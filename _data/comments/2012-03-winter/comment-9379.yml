text: "You are right--what you are going through is completely normal, and I think everyone who lives abroad has to deal with it at some time or other.  Let&#39;s face it--there are things in your life that are completely worth missing a lot.  And I concur.  Spring should give you a really big lift, and help propel you forward to your next adventures.<br /><br />As for your co-teacher, it isn&#39;t just Korea that has semi-adequate foreign language teachers, especially at the lower levels.  If you learn a language in a classroom setting you need to supplement that with some immersion somewhere, because otherwise you&#39;ll never really have it.  Unless, of course, you are in a country where you have your native language but hear English all the time on TV or on the street.  I think of Scandinavia, where the kids speak better English than half the kids at Hamilton High School.<br /><br />Anyway, we miss you too.  Happy birthday in a few days, and be watching for a package from us.  Grandma"
