text: "Great to hear your having such an amazing time. Sounds like you&#39;ve really come into your element. You were made for this shit. Some really great vagabonding tales. You put my small rushed blogs to shame. We&#39;re heading into Laos tomorrow. The adventure continues. Keep doing what you do.<br /><br />Best of luck in Europe.<br /><br />Sean"
