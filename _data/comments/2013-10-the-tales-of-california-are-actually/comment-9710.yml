text: "And just when I was starting to wonder if we&#39;d ever hear from you again!  (Always there&#39;s Grandma-worry.)  i am so glad to hear you are happily in the Bay area.  Are you heading east through Colorado?  If so, there are Uncle Howard and Aunt Lois to visit, and Tom and Toy Herring.  <br /><br />Hope to see you in the not too distant future, though.  Thanksgiving will soon be here!  Grandma"
