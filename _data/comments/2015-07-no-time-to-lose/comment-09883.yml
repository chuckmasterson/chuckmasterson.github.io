text: "My mother was a product of the lifestyle you seek.  Lived off the land, and very unproductive land at that, fifteen miles from the Badlands.  She did it, and if she were alive today she probably could remember the skills, but she wouldn&#39;t choose it, that&#39;s for sure.  So what you are thinking of as looking ahead is just what the world has mostly been until the huge industrial changes of the last century or so.  I wish you the best of success in your endeavor to capture the simple pre-industrial lifestyle."
