text: "Grandma - Yep, sometimes the way forward looks suspiciously like the way back. Great Grandma wouldn&#39;t choose again to live in the Badlands and pull a living out of the soil, but the thing is, the &quot;good&quot; choice is a limited-time offer, and if you or your descendants are around when the deal ends, the &quot;good&quot; choice becomes a much worse choice. That&#39;s why I&#39;m getting out.<br /><br />Uncle Chuck - That&#39;s pretty much our plan, to keep doing the stuff that makes a monetary living for us until we know we can be pretty much self-sustained from the land.<br /><br />Dave - You&#39;re confusing &quot;thrive&quot; with &quot;make money&quot;. They are very different things. NYC as a whole does indeed kick the world&#39;s economic derri√®re, but the people living in it - how do they feel? Complete? Science and intuition can both tell you that humans need some time in nature. Wall Street execs use all those wads of money they have on lots of vacations to places that sure as hell aren&#39;t NYC.<br /><br />Anonymous - Hey, I&#39;m glad you found this! I don&#39;t get a whole lot of feedback from folks I don&#39;t know, so it&#39;s nice to know people occasionally find this and like stuff I&#39;ve written."
