text: "My mother and father bought a 20 year old house on 2 acres on the edge of town in Davenport in 1941, 3 months before Pearl Harbor. He started a small Victory Garden in 1942 growing vegetables and continued expanding it through the war and a good 10 years after. And he bought 3 adjacent wooded acres along the way. We raised chickens to eat and for eggs. Mom canned peas and green beans and other things, enough for a year. We grew enough potatoes to last a year. But he kept his regular job to pay the mortgage and buy a car now and then. He put all his spare time into the garden and animals hoping to buy a farm someday but gave that up as being impractical. But he felt what he did was rewarding enough and that the way he did it, convinced him that going into farming full time was not for him.. My sister and I benefited from the experience in many ways. Neither one of us felt the need to garden after that though. You and your friends might try buying an old place where you can live, garden and raise animals. In Minnesota get a place with access rights to a large enough lake where you can also fish for food year round. Keep your day jobs until things get self supporting would be my advice. Go for it and good luck. Uncle Charlie Tuna"
