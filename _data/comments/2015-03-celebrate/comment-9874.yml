text: "It makes me feel so good that you&#39;re involved in saving food for people who can&#39;t afford to buy it.  Beautiful.  And I love your idea of a garden, too.  There&#39;s nothing like picking fresh veggies from your garden and eating them almost immediately.  Yum.<br /><br />I&#39;ll pass on the Bloody Marys though.  I am repulsed by them because of the name.  Ha.<br /><br />Crow Duck will come before you know it.  What fun it will be this summer.   Love you, Grandma"
