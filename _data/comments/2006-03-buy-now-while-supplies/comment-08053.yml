Dr. Tracy is also retiring so it's possible that his replacement may be more inclined to give students the full story behind what often seem like random policies.<br/><br/>There will always be a few bad teachers at any school.  What you have to do is actively seek out the good ones.  It is your education so make it what you want as best you can.  Most teacher's really do want to teach.  This is part of the reason that discipline is like it is.  They are frankly just tired of spending their time and energy trying to enforce the rules on people who don't care and then having to neglect teaching those who are doing it right."
