text: "Hear hear. One reason I'm letting you complete things at Finneytown is because you have a good group of kids there. I'm not at all impressed by the staff. However, I did think the high school staff were a bit better than the middle school. My assumption was clearly wrong, especially as evidenced by your math teacher. <br/>I'm copying your dad on this, too. This is getting more insane every day. Unreal. Unfortunately even the best universities will have a good degree of incompetence and incompetents as well. I came across many in my education at Miami. <br/>Your math teacher clearly went to the Al Gore School of Higher Arithmetic (aka \"fuzzy math\") if that's the way things are being taught. Wasn't she working for Enron at one time? (sigh)<br/><br/>Unforfrackinforreal."
