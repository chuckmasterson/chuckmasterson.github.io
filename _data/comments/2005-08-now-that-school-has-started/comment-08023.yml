text: "The links are messing up too.  I don't know how you format it, but they're all showing up with http://www.chuckmasterson.blogspot.com smashed in front of the actual URL.  This is one of the reasons I don't use blogger.  My \"blog\" (more or less) has also been updated for only the second time (more or less) if anybody is interested.<br/><br/>http://www.geocities.com/mrebman88/blog.html"
