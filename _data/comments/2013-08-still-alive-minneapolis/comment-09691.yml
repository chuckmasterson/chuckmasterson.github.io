text: "Mom says: <br />Nice post! Glad you like Minneapolis. I like it, too Just not in the winter (I&#39;ve been there in the winter).<br /><br />I (your humble author) say: <br />If I decide to live in Minneapolis, I suspect the first year will be a trial phase for me to see how well I stand up under a long, long winter. It&#39;s not the intensity I think I might mind, it&#39;s the lack of anything growing for half the year. It makes me think, from an ecological angle, &quot;Dang, if I had a homestead around here, I would be idling for a real long time every year. What would I do? What would I eat if I were growing my own food?&quot;<br /><br />By the way, this region does seem highly popular for homesteads. I got a ride from a homesteader on the way in, and he took me to his place and I saw his chickens and farm. And of course there&#39;s also the Keppers farm that I stayed at in May, and I swear there were one or two others around here, but I&#39;d have to go back to the journal maybe to remember them.<br /><br />(Also, this moving of Mom&#39;s comment from Facebook to here is part of trying to train everyone to leave their comments here, not there...)"
