text: "I would suck it up and come in when they ask...it&#39;s too early to rock the boat. It&#39;s tough to learn the manners and politeness rules of a new culture. Maybe once you are settled and have a routine and prove you are doing a good job, you can question it again...sounds like they have their unwritten rules for teachers...half an hour is not a big deal and it&#39;s better to be prepared and ready than to walk in late. Would love to see some pics of you and the kiddos.<br />Mom"
