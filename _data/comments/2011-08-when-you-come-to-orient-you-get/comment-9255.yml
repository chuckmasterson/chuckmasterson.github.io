text: "Amazingly enough, your early experiences as a teacher are very similar to mine.  The shock at knowing how politics runs the school, instead of logic, merit, or any thing besides sucking up to the powers that be, who never have any common sense.  School administrators must be the same world round--you succeed when you make them look good and fail when you buck the current, even if you are TOTALLY in the right.  I agree with your mom.  Go with the flow when you are new and don&#39;t yet know the rules.  If you don&#39;t, you will always be ostracized.  And always remember, it&#39;s a life experience, one very few of us get a chance to have, and even if you were in the States in your first job, you&#39;d be having the same pecking order experiences.  That&#39;s life after college.  Suck it up.  And enjoy your year there and your new found friends.  Grandma"
