text: "Did you know the magazube you are featured in arrived out our house and I've been showing it to everyone? Of 25 up and coming new talents, you are up and coming new talent #21. You are grouped with 3 other guys who have had no formal training in the graphic arts yet love to do them anyway.  <br/><br/>For everyone interested: buy or order a copy of Step Inside Design, current edition which talks about 25 fresh talents in the business. :)  It's a really cool graphic arts magazine, a trade magazine for graphic artists and way, way cool. Nathanael is in there and don't forget to read about the other artists in there, too. They are from all over the world- US, Poland, Japan, Colombia, etc. Check it out!<br/><br/>MOM<br/>PS you are close to where your dad lived and I have also been to Spain though too long ago and not to that city so I will visit you. It is so long since I went to Spain that it will be almost like going for theh first time."
