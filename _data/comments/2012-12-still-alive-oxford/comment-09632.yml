Sorry to disappoint everyone who wants to be the first one to see me, but it makes the most sense for me to get picked up by Dad because all my stuff is at his house. But, do we know what day the respective Christmases are happening in Oxford and with Dad&#39;s side (wherever that&#39;s happening)?"
