text: "Things have changed a bit.  David and his family have decided to go to church services on Saturday night, so they will not have to leave on Christmas Eve day at 5.  They will plan to stay through the evening.  So, everything can now be pushed back.  We can open presents whenever everyone gets here, whenever that is.  And then stay and have a good dinner.  Grandpa won a ham out at the Bath Conservation Club this afternoon.  Yeah, a whole ham.  Come hungry.  Ha.  I hope this will make things easier for you to manage when you get to Cincinnati.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy Stone Henge on solstice, you lucky guy.  Grandma"
