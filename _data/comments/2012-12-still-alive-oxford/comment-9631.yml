text: "Let me suggest that you wear shoes before you attack Isengard. In that vein, let me also suggest footwear on the Grey dog. I have heard of unexpected debris on bus floors. In any event, shoes or not, I will be at the terminal to pick you up at 1000h EST on 24DEC. Be sure to correct any misconceptions I may have regarding your arrival."
