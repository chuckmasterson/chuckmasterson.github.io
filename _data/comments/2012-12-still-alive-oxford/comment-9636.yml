text: "We have been informed by the David Troxels that they will be able to come to our house on the 24th precisely from 12 to 5 PM.  I think this is because they want to go to church in Kentucky on Christmas Eve, and then spend Christmas Day with Kim&#39;s family.  Dan and family will be here on both eve and day, as will your mother and Micah and presumably Deanna.  So it would probably be best for you to try to head up here (Oxford)<br /> soon after you&#39;re able to go to your Dad&#39;s house and settle in with your things, etc.<br /><br />If this doesn&#39;t work, however, we&#39;ll figure something else out, but it looks as though the David&#39;s will want to open presents on Christmas Eve day.  Not our usual procedure, but hey, we&#39;re going to try to make things work out for everyone.<br /><br />Also, since the 24th is your Mom&#39;s birthday, we&#39;ll try to celebrate that after David&#39;s family leaves in the evening.<br /><br />Prime rib/crab dinner will be fixed on Christmas Day, and it should be fairly peaceful since no one will be anticipating presents any more.  We&#39;ll also have the pool tournament then.<br /><br />Hope this helps.  Just don&#39;t worry about it.  Grandma"
