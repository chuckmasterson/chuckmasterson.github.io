text: "I agree.  Never be bored!  But I still don&#39;t like to see you hopping trains.  I&#39;d rather see you on that cargo ship, slaving away at the dirtiest jobs they have.  No boredom there, but maybe sore muscles instead.<br /><br />Grandpa and I just got back today from Iceland and Greenland.  They are both places you would love--lots of adventuresome types there.  Saw the volcano that erupted and brought back some ash from it.  Call us when you are in town so we can see you.  Grandma"
