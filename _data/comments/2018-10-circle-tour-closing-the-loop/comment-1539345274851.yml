It could have been the Superior sea, or Superior channel if it had succeeded in splitting North America in two. It also has a hydrological retention rate of 191 years. So undoubtedly you took a leak in the lake or one of it’s many rivers emptying into it. Your contributions will stay for generations to come. By comparison, the diminutive Lake Erie drains in a scant 2.6 years.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy Grandma’s marathon, which runs point to point, right along the lake from Two Harbors all the way to Duluth. I’m planning on doing it again this next summer."
