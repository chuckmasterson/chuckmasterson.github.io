It sounds like you've got a pretty good internal compass that lets you feel fulfilled on your own terms, though, no matter what the Korean education system thinks. Which is good, because the Korean education system's standards are weird, arbitrary, and inhuman, at least if my experience with the primary schools is anything to go by. What's next for you?\r\n\r\n(Hmm... it's Christmastime here, and while I'm thinking about gifts, maybe I can think about something to send in the mail your way...)"
