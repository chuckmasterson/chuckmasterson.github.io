  Grandma and I have seen some of this but not nearly as Close, with all of the
  smells and sights thru bikimg.  Fit, I declare ye 'fit as a fiddle'.  In
  addition, I challenge you to a cribbage game,  perhaps your Uncle Howard,
  cousin Carrie, you and I can have a round robin tournament in Crow Duck next
  yea, if ya' aren't skeered????  Your trip description transported me to a
  different time, a different place and certainly a different age.  For that I
  thank you.
