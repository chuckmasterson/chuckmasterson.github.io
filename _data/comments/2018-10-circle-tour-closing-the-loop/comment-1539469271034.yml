For a while I thought the whole thing was carved by the last round of glaciers, but something told me there must be more to it. Where did you learn about the rift valley? One of my favorite facts is that it has more water than the other four Great Lakes combined.\r\n\r\nI haven't run Grandma's, but I've eaten there with Dan's family. Good onion rings."
