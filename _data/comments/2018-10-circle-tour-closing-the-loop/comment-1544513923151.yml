  When someone else might use a easier approach to see nature, as going
  somewhere with cars, you guys chose the best way to experience it. Also
  reading your blogs (like i said million times) showed me that life is not just
  about getting a job, getting a partner, having a family. but it is also how we
  understand our existence, our nature, etc. While I am typing this, I already
  got my result of my thesis presentation and I didnt get the good result. But I
  will never make the result of my thesis control my life. I learnt from your
  adventure and my own experiences that things dont always work like we expect.
  But always there is a suprise there. Let me read the next story hehehe
