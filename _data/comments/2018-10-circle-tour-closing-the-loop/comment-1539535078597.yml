Reading this made me laugh and miss our little temporary riding gang. Nice to recall those days of getting comfy cozy =) AND Katie is totally a fount of conversation- spot on description and I like that word, fount.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wanted to get in touch with you to because i never got to say good-bye as it did seem you did disappear without announcement. Anyway, wanted to wish you luck on your next endeavor, and i hope Chequamegan bay becomes one of your many homes so that our paths will cross more often. I am curious about your next move, any news on line 3?\r\n  \r\nDont be a stranger hobo,\r\nAva"
