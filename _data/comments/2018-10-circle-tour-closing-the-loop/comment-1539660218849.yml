text: "Hey Ava! I haven't heard back from the Line 3 folks, apparently it takes them a while sometimes because there's not really any, whatchacallit, electricity at the camp. I'm glad you liked the story---it's nice to have this stuff written down somewhere to keep around.\r\n\r\nDidn't realize it seemed like I just disappeared. (From my perspective, I was right there the whole time.) But I guess we didn't really say much of a goodbye at the party that night, and then I expected I'd see you to give back your cookware, but by the time I got to town the next day you'd already up and headed to Door County... in any case, settling down at the Chequamegon Bay is my current plan, so whenever you make the trek back we should be able to hang out."
