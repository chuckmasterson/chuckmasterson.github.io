  Gabe and Erica both---I always feel funny writing about my life journey,
  because I always wonder, Who wants to read about some other person's abstract
  epiphanies? I guess I shouldn't worry about it---it sounds like at least the
  two of you are glad to hear about it, and I'm touched that you both felt it so
  deeply. Thank you.
