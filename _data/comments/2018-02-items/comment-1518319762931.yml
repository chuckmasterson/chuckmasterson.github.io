text: "Wisdom cannot be accelerated. I felt that I quit making poor life choices by the age of around 21. Little did I know I was still blundering along, blind to my infirmities. Once you reach my age, you realize that most people 'spend' their lives trying to undo the mistakes made up to about age 30. Everyone feels they are the exception to the rule, but most people can't really look under the hood until at least their late 20's.\r\n\r\nIt gets batter."
