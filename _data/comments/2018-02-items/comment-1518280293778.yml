  I am glad to know that you found your wound. I am strongly believe you and
  Misty will be better and stronger after the healing process. For me, one time
  I started to feel being in comfort zone, I feel i do not really live in the
  world. Every thing becomes routines. Btw, where i have to send letter or
  package? better to sprout house or ARC?
