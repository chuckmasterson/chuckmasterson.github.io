text: "Well, I think you made the right choice as well.  The Miami crowd is a bit more materialistic than you probably care to be involved with.  I do have to point out though that in your pro-con list you mentioned Miami's ice rink.  That can only mean that you are a closet hockey fan. And had I not exposed you in that last sentence you would still be in the closet. <br/><br/>Just one piece of advice as you move forward in life.  Swallow your bread all the way down before burping and sipping your root beer, this will help avoid snarfing and causing hot college chicks to dislike you.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>Dan"
