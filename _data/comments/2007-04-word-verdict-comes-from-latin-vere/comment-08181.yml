text: "Yup, I too think you made the right choice.  And I'm no more prejudiced than Aunt E.<br/><br/>I have sent you a book written by a G. professor, who just happens to teach creative writing... <br/><br/>I met him at the reunion last year when he talked about his book to the alumni, and I really wanted to read it because it was about autism.<br/><br/>I emailed him to thank him for the book and tell him how much I had enjoyed reading it (and that I had sent it to my whole family).  He responded within the hour thanking me for the support, telling me to let him know if I was ever on campus, and asking me to tell my Grinnell-bound grandnephew to drop by and see him.<br/><br/>Hint:  Authors love to talk about their books!  I imagine he would really like to hear your point of view, especially if it's a positive one.<br/><br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>Love, Aunt I."
