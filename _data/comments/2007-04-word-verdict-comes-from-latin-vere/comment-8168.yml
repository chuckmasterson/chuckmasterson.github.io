text: "Way to go!  I like the way you reason things out.  And you're right.  There are some good forests in Iowa.  We had some in Des Moines, and there's a place called the Ledges State Park, which is supposed to be pretty.  Great Grandpa's farm had a tree or two on it.  Ha.  And there are Maquoketa Caves near the Wapsipinicon River.  In northwest Iowa there are Spirit Lake and Lake Okoboji.  So it's not completely corn fields.  And anyway, corn fields are beautiful when you make your living from them.  You will love Iowa.   Grandma"
