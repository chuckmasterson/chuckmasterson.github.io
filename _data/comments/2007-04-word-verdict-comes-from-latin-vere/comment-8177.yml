text: "In my prejudiced opinion, you made an excellent choice!  But then you'd have done well no matter where you'd have chosen to go.  Your education will be as good as the effort you put into it.  <br/><br/>Since the mighty elms were removed from the campus in the 1960's, Grinnell has made a great effort to plant a variety of trees on campus.  Once (in the 1950's) I had an assignment to identify the Latin names of all the trees on campus for a biology class, and I was dumbfounded to discover how many there were.<br/><br/>Of course none of the professors from that era are still teaching, but as I look back at the ones who influenced me the most, they weren't necessarily in the major fields I was studying.  One of the greatest was Grant Gale, a physics prof for whom the observatory was named.  Another was William Guillermo, the biology prof from the class mentioned above.  <br/><br/>You will have so many opportunities to learn, probably far beyond what you currently can invision.  I wish you well.<br/><br/>And yes, you will get homesick.  But that will subside as time goes by.  You will make new friends and find much to do.  <br/><br/>As for the weather, yes, it can get very cold in Grinnell, and it can snow a lot.  But it doesn't stay cold, and it doesn't snow, all winter long.  There will be mild periods along the way.  <br/><br/>As for visitors, we may stop by sometime, coming or going to/from Arizona.  And I have plans to attend the 1959 class reunion two years from now.  However, students usually leave before reunion week.<br/><br/>Yes, it seems strange to me to have another family member heading to Grinnell after all these years.  But I couldn't be more pleased.  Way to go, class of 2011.<br/><br/>Aunt E.<br/><br/>P.S.  And enjoy Rock Creek State Park!!!!!"
