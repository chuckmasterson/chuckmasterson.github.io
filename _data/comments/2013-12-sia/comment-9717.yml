text: "I Googled around a bit for tea stores in Cincinnati. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything comparable to the one in Seattle/San Francisco (which is called Vital Tea Leaf, by the way), so you probably won&#39;t be able to do a tasting unless you buy a bunch of varieties and stage a tasting of your own. (Invite the whole neighborhood!) But there are a couple likely candidates for a good place for tea. One is called Teavana in Ye Olde Kenwood Towne Centre. I&#39;ve never been there. Another is the tea section at Jungle Jim&#39;s, which is likely to have some interesting stuff, though maybe not much in the way of guidance. I have bought tea at neither of these places. Otherwise you can order from Vital Tea Leaf on the internet, or you can first seek guidance from this great website I just found, Steepster. It&#39;s a site where tea connoisseurs find really good teas and then review them and rate them. The site itself doesn&#39;t sell anything, which I think is great because then it&#39;s neutral. It&#39;s just a forum. To actually buy the tea you just Google the name of the tea and the company, and buy from them. Thanks to Steepster I&#39;m now considering buying a cake of pu-erh, now that I can tell where to get stuff that&#39;s good."
