text: "Hi Alfi! Blogger thought you were a spammer, I guess probably because your IP is in Indonesia and I don&#39;t have a lot of readership there. But I definitely remember you! It was pretty wild meeting a stranger and having Korean be one of our lingua francas.<br /><br />I didn&#39;t really know much about the history of tea in the US, but I found this <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_tea_culture\" rel=\"nofollow\">neat little article</a> that explains it. It looks like tea was popular in the early years of the country because the US was still a very British place. But then the British started putting really high taxes on the tea, which led to the Boston Tea Party (where a bunch of guys threw loads of tea off of a British boat to protest the taxes), and from there things went downhill fast for tea. People started thinking of it as a British-only thing, and that image has stuck around all these 240 years. Even today I sometimes feel a little British when I drink tea, which causes me to do the accent—but that&#39;s just me. But lately it&#39;s making a comeback. Coffee is still way more popular, but people are starting to once again appreciate really good tea here. It&#39;s still hard to find a decent tea shop, but you can order good stuff online from American companies. Oh, by the way, from that article I also learned hat the teabag was invented in America in 1908.<br /><br />Of course it&#39;s fine if you read the blog! That&#39;s what it&#39;s there for. My English is trickier than a lot of people&#39;s sometimes, because I sprinkle in stuff from other languages, talk about word histories, make stupid puns, and write irresponsibly long sentences—but a challenge is always fun, right?<br />한국 떤난 후에 한국말 많이 잊었어요, 연습 거의 안했어요... 언어를 말할 수 있는 친구가 없어서 어려워요. 다른 시간 할 계획 처럼 생각해요..."
