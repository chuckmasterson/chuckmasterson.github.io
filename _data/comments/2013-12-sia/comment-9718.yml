text: "I found your blog! Do u still remember me? Yeah I hope so, we met in border between cambodia and Thailand.  You was the one who showed korean money to a latin guy. However, your posting is interesting. As east asian people, I do love tea. We brew tea for breakfast, lunch even dinner. I tasted jasmine tea, lychee tea, Japanese tea (ocha), black tea, bubble tea (i love taiwanese bubble tea), thai green tea(my favourite),korean tea (nokcha) rosella tea etc. And still want to taste more various of it, for me tea bar is better than coffe shop. But ive a couristy about tea in america, in history we all know about boston tea party , so it showed that tea wasnot strange thing in us, but then it seemed less popular than coffee or softdrink, why it happened?<br />Btw, Is it allright to read all your blog? I will observe how did you write your idea into passages , that will help me to improve my writing skill also my reading skill."
