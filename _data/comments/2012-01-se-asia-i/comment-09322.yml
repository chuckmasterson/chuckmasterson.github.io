text: "Yeah, that&#39;s where the Trans-Siberian Railway leaves from. So I plan on hanging around for at least a few days. I&#39;ll have to buy a Chinese visa to go through there anyhow, so I might as well get a little more value out of it, is my thinking.<br /><br />Technically I suppose it&#39;s the Trans-Mongolian that starts there, and the Trans-Siberian starts in Vladivostok. But I&#39;m not worrying about technicalities... and I always still tell people &quot;Trans-Siberian&quot; because I join the TS when I get out of Mongolia to the north."
