text: "Be glad you missed this storm.  I don't think you'd be going barefoot through our foot of snow.  Hope you don't get buried with too much work.  Your classes sound interesting but also a lot of work.  One of these days I'll get into the kitchen and get some ginger snaps made.  And try not to let Grandpa eat a bunch before I can get them mailed.  Ha.  Grandma"
