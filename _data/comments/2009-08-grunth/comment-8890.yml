text: "Since this is the easiest way for me to reach your mother, could you let your parents know that it would be a good idea to call for reservations at that Holiday Inn in Crystal Lake, three miles from Ellen&#39;s.  And to let them know to keep in contact with us as to when they&#39;re going.  Evidently, Deb is planning to hostess the family on Friday evening for dinner, if your family is there yet, which they probably won&#39;t be.  But let them know, anyway.  We can get directions to her house and give them to you, too.  Thanks.  Grandma"
