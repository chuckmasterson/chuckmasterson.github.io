text: "Believe it or not, i&#39;m going to stick up for the cops. It may be a hollow excuse, but people get jaded and fatalistic in the cop business. When at least 50% of the people you talk to are lying, partially lying, rationalizing, blaming, scapegoating, blaming their parents, blaming their kids, or otherwise not taking responsibility for their actions, you just cease to give a f*ck anymore. I have empathy, dealing with the same mental illness BS for years, sometimes I just want to lash out. When it&#39;s the same crap and you can fill in the blanks, finish the script, and read what you are going to say before you say it, job satisfaction goes downhill for these guys.<br /><br />You were guilty by generalization, but I bet if you are genuine and empathize with him you would see a different side.<br /><br />Or he could just be an asshole. i doubt it though.<br /><br />Dave"
