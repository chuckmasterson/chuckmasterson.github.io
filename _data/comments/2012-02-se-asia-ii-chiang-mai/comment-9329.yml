text: "They had dragonfruit at Jungle Jim&#39;s last time I went there. If you&#39;re in town again, check them out again... I guess they&#39;ve improved their delivery system. Becuase I&#39;d had it before at Jungle Jim&#39;s, I didn&#39;t actually have any while I was there (I think... but actually, maybe I had a little, I don&#39;t know). I think just eating them straight is all they do with them. And they are pretty delicious."
