text: "I meant to note that almost everything besides the pad Thai requires weird ingredients that would be hard to find back home. Not even sure if I <i>could</i> find some of the things  that go into the curry paste, anywhere—like kaffir lime peel, sweet basil, galangal, shrimp paste. But I&#39;d love to cook a bunch of stuff when I get back. Thai lunch, Korean dinner, perhaps.<br /><br />I was wondering—do you guys think these are too long and detailed, or not long and detailed enough?"
