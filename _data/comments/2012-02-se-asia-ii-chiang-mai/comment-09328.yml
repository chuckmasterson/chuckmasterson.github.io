text: "I love the fact that you found dragonfruit!  That was a real treat I discovered in Vietnam, and have tried to find elsewhere ever since.  (And no, they don&#39;t have it at Jungle Jim&#39;s!  It doesn&#39;t keep that well.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ever imported to the U.S.)  But I&#39;m curious if you or they did anything with it besides cut it open and eat it.  It is yummy just that way!<br /><br />Aunt E."
