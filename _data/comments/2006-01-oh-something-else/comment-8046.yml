text: "holy cow it has been a long time since I considered college entrance.  Ok, first off get on the phone and call the admissions offices for the colleges. They can give you all the information you need and then some.  Humans still have the edge over the internet.  Second, your school should have a guidance counselor to help with the process.  Check it out.<br/><br/>Thirdly, investigate visiting the campuses during the summer visiting programs.  Nice deal, go visit, stay the weekend.  My sister did that, I didn't because I knew that I was going to CU.  Read that as I didn't research and now wonder if I shorted myself.  I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up until oh... last year???  Go figure.<br/><br/>For you, I see looking at a good writing school, you have a gift.  That is a career that you could do while in your cabin in the woods.  Of course I hear writers don't get paid much.  ;-)"
