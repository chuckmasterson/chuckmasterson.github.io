text: "I didn't realize my praise would be taken as a recommendation. You all should know by now that I have peculiar taste in a lot of things, so I take no blame if Nj√°l's Saga isn't for you. But having said that, I think you may like it anyhow. It doesn't have an overarching plot; rather, it's more of a history of a bunch of guys who lived in Iceland aroud the turn of the millennium (a couple genturies before the manuscript was written). But they do interesting things. One thing you'll have to prepare for - there are a <i>lot</i> of names, and a fair amount of them belong to people who are actually relevant to the story. Some of them are the same, only differing by the patronymic. And it's easy to lose track of patronymics, because they all end it -son. The chapter names are like ones in the Bible, offering little summaries; one of them is \"The Two Thorgeirs Plan to Attack Gunnar\". So, that's that about names. So as long as you know that background stuff, you may quite like it. If not, you'll know a lot about 11th-century Iceland."
