text: "Pretty cool that you are taking an intrest in the plains indians. Is there anywhere that you can find arrowheads, scrapers and such? When you get back to O-town I can show you where to find some in Pefer(sp.?) park. I thought I would look around in there and found two arrowheads and a scraper. There are lots of good finds to be had around there. I think the indians would stampede game off of the bluffs and then finish them off at the bottom. Lots to find if you are patient.<br/><br/>Dave"
