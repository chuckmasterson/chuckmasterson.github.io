She was not allowed to stay home alone, so we brought her here.  She wanted to work tomorrow, but that&#39;s not gonna happen.  She&#39;s not allowed to drive for 24 hours.  Right now she is sleeping.  She had some wonton soup minus the wontons, and I hope it helped her feel somewhat better.  Liquid diet tonight, doctor&#39;s orders.  <br /><br />Love you, and waiting for more info about your new girlfriend.  Grandma"
