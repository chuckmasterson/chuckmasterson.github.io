text: "Are you able to leave your car at Manito-wish to rendezvous with people going up to Crowduck? Just a thought, so you don't have to make the drive up to Crowduck alone. That's a buncha gas. <br /><br />As with living with a woman, um, good luck, especially with privacy issues and all...and what if this thing turns out to get romantic and then ends, then what? That can get uncomfortable. Just my .02. It can work but you know we women are hard to live with. Hopefully this will be platonic and you'll feel like she's a sister. At least that would be easiest. Seems in situations like this rules of \"we're all platonic here\" are made, but then someone is attracted to someone, and pretty soon you've got a little Peyton Place going on there. Just to let you know these things happen. Trying to name everything \"gender-neutral\" does not neutralize these things that happen.<br />MOM"
