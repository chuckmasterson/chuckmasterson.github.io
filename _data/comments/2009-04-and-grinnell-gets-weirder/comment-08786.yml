text: "I'm pretty sure platonically is how we're approaching this whole thing. Neither of us (as far as I know, at least) are actually gender-neutral, so that'll lend a certain flavor to our rooming situation, but I think we're both mature enough to handle living with each other. As for when she wants to be with her boyfriend, I don't see why that would be any more awkward than when a male roommate would want to be with his girlfriend. I don't deal with that much this year because Aaron and I are both bachelors still, and last year was a bit of a special case what with Jeremy, but it's been managed successfully many, many times in this college. <br /><br />Incidentally, Jeremy is no longer at the college. The Registrar obviously doesn't put up a notice where his online profile was that says why he's not around anymore, but my informed guess (and Ben's too) is that he probably flunked out."
