text: "I can't believe you will have a female roommate.  What has Grinnell come to?  Ha.  When your grandpa and I were at Drake not only did we have separate dorms, but the men were hardly allowed inside ours.  And we women had hours.  We had to be in by 10:30 on weekdays and 1 AM on weekends.  If we were late we got late minutes, and after 15 late minutes we got campused.  Grounded to our rooms for a weekend night.  Grandpa used to kiss me goodnight in front of the dorm at 10:30, and by 10:31 he was at Peggy's Tavern guzzling beer with his fraternity buddies.  It's a wonder he ever got through college.  I always thought it was unfair for the girls to have hours when the boys could stay out all night if they wanted.  Our old Dean of Women would have had a heart attack on the spot if she ever thought men and women would room together.  <br /><br />Well, if you're OK with it, I am too.  You will find out what having sisters is like.  Grandma"
