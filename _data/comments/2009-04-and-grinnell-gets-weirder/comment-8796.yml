text: "I thought Crowduck started on July 17th. I figured you'd probably pick me up in Boulder Junction the 15th, we'd stay the night around there somewhere, cross into Canada on the 16th and stay in Kenora that night, and then go to Crowduck the next day. Was I completely wrong on the dates? I told Manito-wish I could be there until the 15th, but I can most likely correct that if I need to."
