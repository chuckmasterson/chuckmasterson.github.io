Nat only .......GOPHER IT!)<br /><br />Na, seriously though, Tracy and I are so happy you will make the Crowduck trip again this year.  You are the perfect age for babysitting! And, since we know you're broke, we figure you'll do it for nickles... Canadian ones at that.  Ha Ha.<br /><br />Okay, Dave predicts survival, I predict that the femanina roommate attacks him before it's all over. I mean that in a good way.  I bet she falls for you, ya big lug ya.  The fact is you are a lot like I was, that is, shy around girls.  I was terrible at knowing when girls were interested, and even worse at making a move once I knew they were. I'm serious, ask Tracy about our first date.  It's a miserable story about a guy that was clueless.<br /><br />Oh, and Ann, things are good.  you're good and don't forget it.  your compassion for your kids is testimony as to just how great a mother you really are. We all love you.<br /><br />Dan"
