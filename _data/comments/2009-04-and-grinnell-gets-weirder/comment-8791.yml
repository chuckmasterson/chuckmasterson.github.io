text: "Well I mean, you've been living with a woman for fifty years, Grandpa, and you seem quite married. Plus, lots and lots of guys grow up with sisters.<br /><br />By the way, Mom, I got word back from the Manito-wish people that I can leave my car in their lot while I go to Canada. Who's picking me up from there? Whoever it is, I guess I'll have to give you their location:<br />http://www.manito-wish.org/about/location.html<br /><br />What day will I be getting picked up?"
