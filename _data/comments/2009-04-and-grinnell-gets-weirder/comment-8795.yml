text: "Nathanael, it will be Grandpa and I who will be picking you up.  Sometime between now and then we'll coordinate our schedules and find out how to get there, etc.  I am so glad you will be able to leave right from there to go to Crow Duck.  It might help if you have a chance to wash clothes, etc. right before we get you, but if you can't, there's a laundry in the motel in Kenora where you can regroup.  You will maybe be sharing a room there with Uncle Howard, Grandpa's brother.  We're getting him in Duluth like last year.  Hope you don't mind, because it saves money.<br /><br />I'm going to go look up the date.  It's Wednesday, July 8 we'll be staying the night in Duluth, so sometime that day we'll get you.  Grandma"
