text: "btw the fat armpits were all sitting near ME during the competition. <br /><br />Arms with pits, arms holding a cayuuuute baby, and arms that do not stop waving hello when their owners do- like mine- there were arms everywhere. I mean, everyone I saw had them. Trendy!<br /><br />I don't know what I would do without arms, but oddly enough I've seen people who don't have them, and, well, some of them still have armpits and some don't. Some just have one armpit. But they do use their feet to write, swat flies, and play \"Unchained Melody\" on the guitar. Neat, huh? I'm a weird mom."
