text: "I did not know how much I sound like Joe. I bet the resemblance is uncanny, though. I don&#39;t blame Joe for giving in. It&#39;s a hard system to fight, and at absolutely every turn you&#39;re encouraged to give in and pursue the American dream through the typical channels. You have to be sort of plated in steel to do anything that&#39;s seriously against the grain in this culture. I&#39;m trying to put on a few coats of it myself right now.<br /><br />As to Crowduck, well, if we had a system full of functional land-sensitive communities, we wouldn&#39;t be able to make the annual migration, but then again, we also would also have nature around us here in Ohio, and we wouldn&#39;t feel that impoverished for not having the opportunity to go that far north. We&#39;d have the opportunity to do our family togetherness during, say, an annual hunt and feast. It&#39;s hard to say what we&#39;d do, but I think we&#39;d manage to get some similar happiness going.<br /><br />I will stick around long enough for dinner Sunday. It&#39;s a logical move anyhow, since I&#39;m heading north (to Michigan), and leaving from Oxford gets me out of the 275 ring. Howzabout if I stay the night and leave Monday morning?"
