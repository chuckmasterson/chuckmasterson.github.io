But then you shouldn&#39;t be living your granny&#39;s dreams, but your own.  So I will wish you well on the next soul searching journey.<br /><br />As for your sounding like Joe, well, he picked up where the 60&#39;s hippies left off in the fantasy world of natural living, sort of a la Rousseau.  It didn&#39;t work for the hippies, except maybe for a few aging college profs who&#39;ve spent their lives preaching it.  It didn&#39;t work for Joe.  And it remains yet to be seen whether it will work for you.  I&#39;ll probably be six feet under, or more likely in a jar, when you come to your life conclusions.  But I wish you well in your venture.<br /><br />As for Crowduck, I think both Grandpa and I feel that we&#39;ve been able to instill the love of nature in the kids and grandkids, for the most part, by taking the trek up there every year.  But it didn&#39;t come free, and the money we have now is partly due to the fact that my grandfather and father were both canny and successful businessmen.  They were also amazingly charitable, and also great nature lovers.  But that&#39;s beside the point.  And your grandfather had to work very hard in the system to get where he was in life, and he is and should be proud of all that he did.  So we don&#39;t discount good and honest living within the &quot;system&quot;, however bad you think it is.  When and if you decide to join it, I think you&#39;ll find a fantastic and successful place in it.<br /><br />I am going to google paleo/saffron and find something for Sunday dinner.  That Spanish saffron I bought should be used, and why not now?<br /><br />Later, Grandma"
