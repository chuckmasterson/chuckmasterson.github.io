text: "Chuck, as someone who has just left the protective bosom of the academy to shackle themselves to the cruel wheel of industry, be in no hurry to do the same! That said, people need some kind of rhythm to life. It doesn&#39;t have to look like remunerative labor, but you&#39;ve got to find a pattern for yourself at some point. Your own little ecological niche, if you will.<br /><br />How clear is it where &#39;nature&#39; ends? Sure, I&#39;d say that a city street is not a backyard is not a national park is not a swath of wilderness, but people are a part of their environment. You talked about the Amazon, but forgot to mention my favorite part about those orchards: the soil is a human-made mixture of earth, pottery shards, showing evidence of heavy fertilizer use. And that soil is responsible for nourishing the wildlife much better than would be possible without human intervention.<br /><br />The good ole Western pattern is pretty destructive and self-aggrandizing, but not everything it displaced was bad. Market economies replaced mostly slave economies, in addition to nomadic populations. Even so, whatever we had good has gone far wrong. Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m skeptical of utopian visions, or maybe I&#39;m just prematurely jaded.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for continuing writing your blog, it&#39;s one of my favorite internet reads. Hope that getting out to Vancouver takes you down into my neck of the woods at some point."
