text: "First, I can tell you that you can’t avoid some hard work, no matter what you do, unless of course you become a complete couch potato, in which case you are barely living and will find no satisfaction at all.  You have to move to stay alive.<br />Even when you work at what you love there will be difficult and unpleasant tasks that you really won’t want to do, and you’ll have to do them.  I hate washing dishes, yet I have to do it almost every day.<br />However, I don’t think you’re set at avoiding toil, not at all.  I think you’re set at avoiding mindless toil, and that’s to the good.<br />I suspect that when you hear the phrase “get a job” you really hear “set yourself to a mindless task for the rest of your life.”  This is quite rightly to be avoided.<br />However, I also suspect that when people who love you say “get a job,” what they are really saying is “find your purpose in life and get on with it.”  It looks like that is exactly what you are planning to do.  You’re just saying “give me time to explore all my options,” and that’s fine.<br />I hope you will remember though, that ‘all’ your options may include trying different types of work in different settings.  Finding your purpose often comes after a certain period of finding out what you DON’T want to do, and that often means working at a job you don’t like, for a time.  (kind of like teaching in Korea, maybe, or reading a bunch of badly written, unsolicited manuscripts?)  In some cases that job may be the only way to get started on the road to the work you DO want.  (But of course, not all low-level jobs are going to lead upward.)<br />Finding your purpose (or purposes) is the key, then looking for whatever will allow you to accomplish it – or perhaps that should be written in reverse order as “stumbling across what will allow you to accomplish it and then finding your purpose right there in the stumble.” (And you won’t ever stumble if you are lying around on the couch.)<br />You might ask me at this point what I did.  Fair question.  As a kid I wanted two things out of life – to raise my own family and to be a writer.  I never got the family, so I adjusted myself to find that dream another way.  I tried several jobs I didn’t like and wasn’t good at, but eventually stumbled over the theater/ teaching work in which I could use my writing ability to compose programs for kids.  At their best the programs managed to expand kids’ life experiences and enrich their ability to think and reason.  That was more than enough purpose for my life.  It was often hard work, sometimes I just didn’t want to do it, and occasionally it didn’t seem worth it, but I stuck to it and think I did rather well.<br />(And just a note here – if you’re looking for some better entertainment, try some live theater – Shakespeare, for instance, is pretty darn good stuff.)<br />We are so lucky in this country at this time to have the ability to choose a higher purpose beyond supporting our own and our family’s basic needs.  So many people have never had the option.  Remember, also, that much as you might like to do to fix our society, you are still part of it as it is, (which is too many of us to be able to all live off nature), and you do enjoy some of the benefits of it.  It’s a good thing to be able to call a policeman or fireman if you need one, to have roads and highways to travel on, even to be able to find food in dumpsters or grocery stores, because to get it there a bunch of people had to do some hard work that maybe they didn’t want to do.<br />Now I’m sounding like a preachy old auntie, so I’d better stop.  I’ll just add to listen to your grandma, she’s pretty smart.<br />-- Irene"
