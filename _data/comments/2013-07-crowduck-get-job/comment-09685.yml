text: "Methinks thou is looking for Utopia.  If you find it,  sign me up for a free house and lot,  also freeTV, free food, free car, free Crow Duck fees, etc.  On second thought skip it, I would not do well in Utopia.  I do not mind paying for things I value,  I had a fairy tail job and there is nothing, really important,  that comes to mind that I would change.  I hope you find your Utopia, I believe I found mine."
