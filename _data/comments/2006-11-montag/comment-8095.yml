text: "It has been almost a month since I gave Ms. Miller my college essay to proofread and I still have nothing.  I asked her to have it to me before the Harrison application was due, but obviously that never happened.  I wouldn't count on her finishing your recommendation on time either.  You might want to ask one of the science teachers as well, just to be safe.  They finished mine within a few days and it looks good to have someone with a P.H.D. recommend you.  If nothing else, Mr. Canter and Mr. Kennedy are surprisingly proficient writers as well, and may even have it ready for you the next day."
