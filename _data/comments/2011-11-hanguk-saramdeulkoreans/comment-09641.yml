text: "I agree with the shallow part- I know I&#39;m not being fair to Koreans but I&#39;ve been in a Korean school before. It was definitely not a good experience. All the kids were being mean to this one kid, but before they started doing that, certain people were acting like they were her best friend. Then once she was announced as the &#39;loner&#39; they all started making fun of her like the friendship never even existed! And not just that, dating is based a lot on the looks, smarts, money, stuff like that. I know I need to stop perceiving everyone here as shallow, but you have to admit that A LOT of people ARE shallow here."
