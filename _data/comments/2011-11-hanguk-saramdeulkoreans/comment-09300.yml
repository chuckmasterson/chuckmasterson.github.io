text: "Well, I do not know where to begin.  We (USA) have gone thru the beautiful people syndrome , the most recent in my recollection were the days and dress of the<br />disco era.  Probably not quite the same but the dress and bling of that era was interesting.  Personally I missed it by a few years but I was fascinated by it.  After a few years people got tired of it.  I predict the same for the Koreans.   Another foray into the virtual Korean world for Grandpa.  Thanksgiving will soon be here in the US.  What will you and your friends do?  Do they ave an equivalent in Korea?    Grandpa"
