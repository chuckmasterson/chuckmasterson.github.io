text: "Wow!  So insightful.  I can comment on Berlin--it has not taken very long for the easterners to be absorbed into the western culture. The Brandenburg Gate area is filled with mimes ridiculing the Soviets, and it&#39;s all very capitalistic.  Don&#39;t know about the shallowness, but the people are definitely Western now.  It&#39;s hard to find remnants of the Soviet era in the former GDR.  I think of your foray into North Korea.  Will that place be just like the Brandenburg Gate area someday?  I would think so.  Anyway, i am glad you are getting such a good education on world culture by living it.  Hooray!  Gma"
