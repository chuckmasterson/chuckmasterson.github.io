text: "Your repentance or disdain for the mechanized or &quot;modern&quot; world, or your  move towards a spartan, austere, minimalist lifestyly has implications in the natural world.<br /><br />Someone might suggest that what lies beneath could be a struggle on the spiritual level. You might be yearning for something, and writing some allegory into your life, I think we all do subconsciously to some extent.<br /><br />In other words, I don&#39;t think you are struggling solely just the destruction of the planet, ecology and such. Guilt leading to contrition, or atonement, or a drastic change in lifestyle were just some examples. I would think that you of all people would be open to the possibilty of outward actions having implications on more than one level.<br /><br />Sorry, reading lots of C.S. Lewis which really opens the mind.<br /><br />Dave"
