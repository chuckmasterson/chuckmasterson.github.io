text: "Well I like all of this.  Eating fresh is always good.  However, you need to define store for me.  Does a store have to be in a building?  Is a farmers market a store ( it is certainly a storehouse of food)?  What is a store house?  What do old 73 year olds do when they can neither get into or out of a dumpster---  starve to death or go to a store?   This is fun !!!!!!!    G.Pa."
