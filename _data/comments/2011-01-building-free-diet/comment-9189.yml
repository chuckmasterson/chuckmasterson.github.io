text: "Buy a chicken from a farmer?  As in live?  Brings back a memory from my childhood.  My father, 100% city, for some reason decided to buy and slaughter a live chicken.  I can remember he chopped the thing&#39;s head off in the back yard, and that headless chicken flopped around for minutes.  I thought it was sickening.  Then they burned off  the feathers, and the smell in our basement lasted it seemed like forever.  That was the last time my dad tried to act like a hunter/gatherer.  From then on, grocery stores got all our chicken business.  And that was in the 40s."
