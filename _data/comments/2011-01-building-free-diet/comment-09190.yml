text: "No, no, I mean freshly slaughtered and cleaned. There&#39;s a farm near the college where you can buy chickens like that, I believe. You can also go there and help out on the slaughter day to get a feel for it, and maybe a free chicken, but I don&#39;t remember. There&#39;s a similar farm in <i>The Omnivore&#39;s Dilemma</i>. The author has a pretty interesting account of what it was like to ge help out. My roommate from last year has gone to a slaughter day at the farm around here."
