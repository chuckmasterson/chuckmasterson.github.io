text: "Do you eat ginger cookies if they are sent to you from your grandma who got the ingredients from Kroger?  Don&#39;t know where else to get the stuff for them.  Anyway, one of these days I&#39;ll get a batch made, unless you are doing without those far-from-the-food -source manufactured by Grandma&#39;s hands things.<br /><br />And more power to you for the helping with the deer, and using food that would have gone to waste.  You are going to be on the leading edge of the lifestyle that people will have to accept sooner or later, when the resources run dry.  I am proud of you."
