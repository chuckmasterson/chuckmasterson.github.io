text: "Farmer&#39;s markets are all the suburban rage now. I think you may find that lots of the &quot;local&quot; produce is not so local and comes from the same suppliers that grocery chains buy from. If you buy corn from a farmers market around here, the first of the season is from Florida, later it is Tennessee. Anything from a jar is usually made in a factory in New Jersey or some other factory(ish) city.<br /><br />I think you may find that you, and many other young and idealistic adults will find your persoanl lives emmbodying the qualities of narrative allegory. Your search for or perhaps finding yourself in a place contrition and atonement.<br /><br />You may be &quot;working something out&quot; in the material world only to find that a truth you find will come from from anywhere but the material world.<br /><br />&quot;If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end; If you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair&quot;<br />C.S. Lewis<br /><br />Dave"
