There are still the other sources of food I mentioned. Farmers&#39; markets are accessible to anyone, and the nice thing about them is you can make sure they&#39;re on the level by just asking. &quot;So do you grow this food?&quot; &quot;Where does it come from?&quot; If they don&#39;t have satisfactory answers to these questions, you can just go to a different stall, and they know it. Wild foods grow everywhere, and learning to identify them is going to be a fun project for me that will last me many years, I&#39;m sure. If you want a book about them, I very highly recommend both of Samuel Thayer&#39;s books, <i>The Forager&#39;s Harvest</i> and <i>Nature&#39;s Garden</i>. For meat, if you don&#39;t have a source of deer available to you, there&#39;s certainly at least someplace that sells local beef and chicken, and in Ohio, there&#39;s probably even a farm that you can go to and buy the chicken right from the farmer. The three books I mentioned at the beginning of this post are all great for learning about this stuff and what are the problems with the status quo. <br /><br />Dave, re: narrative allegory, contrition, atonement: Huh?"
