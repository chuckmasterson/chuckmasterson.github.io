text: "I have helped kill, and clean thousands of chickens (Roosters).  Yes I mean thousands.  We used to sell them for $1.00 each , ready for the frying pan or the freezer.  Chop their heads off, then immerse them in boiling water for a few seconds (then strip the feathers off).  After that you have to burn the pin feathers off.  You use brown paper (never newspaper because the ink will get on the chicken and render the chicken worthless), light the paper and roll the chicken around the fire until the pin feathers are removed.  Open the chicken ( belly) and remove the entrails saving the gizzard (yum) and liver (yuck).  Finally a topic in which I have real expertise.   Grandpa"
