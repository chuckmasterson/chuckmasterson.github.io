text: "So that&#39;s why I haven&#39;t seen hide nor hair of you for a while! That explains everything. I&#39;ll blog a fair amount, I expect, but I might try to focus more on postcards and such. I haven&#39;t dropped FB entirely (or actually, at all, so far), but I will, and this blog will become the primary outlet for stuff that I would normally turn into a status update. I sent you a FB message but I&#39;m guessing FB is blocked at your work, so I&#39;ll send you the same thing as an email now. I miss you too. I&#39;d say I can&#39;t wait to be home, but if that were true I&#39;d skip the whole Mongolia-Russia-Europe thing... but I am really looking forward to Christmas and seeing everyone again. Like, a lot."
