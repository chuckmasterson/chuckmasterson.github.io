text: "I admire your honest self-analysis.  You have done what you set out to do, and you&#39;ve made it work for you.  And you&#39;ve managed to see both good and bad about your experience without complaining or tooting your horn.  It all fits into the greater scheme you have for living your life to the fullest and on your own terms.  Not many people out there could do as much.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to our Lisbon days.  Take good care of yourself--you won&#39;t find Russia like Korea in the &quot;trust all the people&quot; way.  Grandma"
