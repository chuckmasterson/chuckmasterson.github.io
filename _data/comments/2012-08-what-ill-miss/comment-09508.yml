text: "I&#39;ve loved sharing your year in Korea via your blog.  Your trip has been something very few people get the opportunity to do, and you&#39;ve made Korea much more real to me than anything else I&#39;ve ever seen or read.  The honesty of your appraisals has been much more helpful than any tourist guide or picture book could ever be.  To spend a year in a place where you know you will never be totally accepted is a huge challenge, and you certainly were up to it.  Thanks so much for sharing.<br /><br />Aunt E."
