text: "We&#39;re looking forward to seeing you really soon.  So glad that you&#39;ve had a chance to see my beloved Paris.  I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d have time for all the things you&#39;ve seen.  <br /><br />Don&#39;t know about presents.  I think both your parents will be busy doing those gifts, but then I don&#39;t really know.  We may have something else in mind.<br /><br />Keep us informed about your activities.  Even though it&#39;s near the end, we&#39;re still anxious to hear about your travels wherever they are.  Love, Grandma"
