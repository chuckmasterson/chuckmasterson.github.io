text: "Well let&#39;s see.  Gifts.  Money always works and you can buy and choose your own &quot;stuff&quot;.  Also the Musee d&#39;Orsay left me with Museum Coma for two years.  It is Huge.  Winged Victory, in the Louvre, is one of my most favorite sculptures of all time.  Sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Paris, with a Cappachino (sp) and people watching was a perfect pastime.  Notre Dame was stunning, especially the flying buttresses.  Finally, Flavia.  Sounds like the flavor of the month, however always remember that one can love rich women as well as poor ones and ones with unlimited bank accounts well .......................I have no words"
