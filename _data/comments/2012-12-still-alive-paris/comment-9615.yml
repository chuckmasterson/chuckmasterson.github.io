text: "I really have no idea what size my head is. I&#39;m sorry. Maybe if you can find an adjustable hat I&#39;ve recently worn, you can deduce from that. If I can, I&#39;ll try to get it measured, maybe in England. That might be possible.<br /><br />I thought of another little thing I&#39;d like: a rain cover for my backpack that&#39;s a bit more subdued and camouflageable than the neon yellow one I have now. I think you probably buy them based on backpack size, and I believe my backpack is 65 liters.<br /><br />I dont&#39;t know whether it&#39;s a lot warmer or colder than usual here - it seems maybe a little above average, but the other day I definitely woke up next to a truck stop with frost on my sleeping bag. Haven&#39;t had that inside Paris, but there&#39;s bound to be an urban heat island effect here. 70Â° is an absurd temperature. It scares me."
