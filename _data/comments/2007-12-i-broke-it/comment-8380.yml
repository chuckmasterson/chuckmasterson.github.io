text: "Not sure who this is, but:<br/><br/>1. Logic must accommodate reality. Reality is the very basis of logic. I don't deny that at all. Thus, if you found incontrovertible evidence of the existence of Heaven and Hell, I would have to reassess the propositions leading to my logical conclusion, because they would have been shown to be obviously faulty. However, I sincerely doubt that will happen, because even though they have supposedly both been around since the Fall, there has never been any incontrovertible evidence for either one's existence. NDEs notwithstanding.<br/>2. If you agree with this point, why are you refuting it? If you are right that Hell isn't conclusively shown to exist in the Bible, does that conflict in the slightest with my conclusion? No, it ony bolsters them. I hadn't heard this viewpoint before, but cursory research reveals Luke 16:22-28, among a few others. <br/>3. I'm not sure how what you're saying relates to my argument. I'll give you my standpoint on free will as of right now: from a theoretical standpoint it doesn't exist, but the neuroscience behind decision-making is so inscrutable and (to borrow a word from quantum physics) indeterminate that, for any and all practical purposes, it might as well. Given the exact position of all particles composing my brain and my environment, you could predict my life course to a tee, but there's far and away too much chaos for that to (ever) mean anything practical. I suggest the book <i>Hidden Minds</i> by Frank Tallis, which I picked up for entirely unrelated reading last year."
