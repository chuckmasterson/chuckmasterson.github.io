text: "I googled and found \"Hidden Minds\" online and have read a good bit of it and will continue to read it. No doubt of the complexities of the human mind and how they affect behavior. We are \"fearfully and wonderfully made\", and there are huge parts of our brain that we never even use.<br/><br/>Funny that a LONG time ago, when I was about 15 years old, I had this exact same conversation with Gma about free will, and ironically I took the stance you show here (that if we have all variables all behavior can be predicted) and Gma expressed that there is still an element of unpredictability involved that any science could not predict. <br/><br/>I arrived a few years later at the conclusion that there is still a \"free will\", whether it is entirely predictable or whether there is some other element involved. <br/><br/>I have many more thoughts on this that I will try to expound on later. Sorry if I am being confusing.<br/><br/>I will try to comment on Lazarus later on. I believe the lesson of charity is the same whether figurative or literal. Would like to see others' comments. I am not as well-versed as many but I do know what I think and indeed I HAVE thought through all of these things before.<br/><br/>Mom"
