text: "That was the most hand-waving answer I've ever, ever seen.<br/><br/>Seems like you're suggesting that maybe we do forget everyone we've loved who's in Hell. So let's say Micah has kids who become Christian. You of course love these grandkids. In about 200 years, everyone involved has died and been sorted out properly. Micah dies an atheist and goes to Hell, so you forget about him. But you love the grandkids in Heaven. So, in what context do you know them? Are they just some people that you love for no reason that you know? The Heaven you're constructing is a place composed entirely of lobotomy patients. All our relationships on Earth exist only in the context of our total relationship to <i>everyone</i> we know, and forgetting even one person we've known while keeping our other relationships precisely the same would require us to be masters of doublethink. We wouldn't be ourselves, I repeat. We would be mindless souls, maybe pawns. Can you give me an answer that's actually an answer? (You kind of remind me of<a href=\"http://www.marriedtothesea.com/122407/intelligent-design-answers-questions-about-biology.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this</a>.)"
