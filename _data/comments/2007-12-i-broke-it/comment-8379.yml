text: "Some questions:<br/><br/>1.  Can logic vanquish reality?  If we prove something illogical, does it cease to exist?  If I am illogical, do I cease to exist?<br/><br/>Does this allow for the existence of heaven or hell regardless if found logical?<br/><br/><br/>2.  Where does the Bible say there is a heaven and a hell?  You left those parts of your proof out.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong.  As a Christian, I also believe in Heaven and Hell but I think many skeptics are hard pressed to locate these obvious items in the Bible.  Honestly, Heaven and Hell are condensations of rudimentary judgment described in the Bible (for ex. a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth)<br/><br/>3.  Why should people not get what they want?<br/><br/>If I want to deny God, why should I not have that eternally?  How is that unfair or cruel?  If I affirm God why should I not have that eternally?  How is that unfair or cruel?  It seems that the illusion of free will is the straw man you are knocking down.  Don't get me wrong-- I believe in free will-- but from the standpoint of an omniscient being, free will is not nearly as interesting as your dilemma supposes.<br/><br/>Good luck."
