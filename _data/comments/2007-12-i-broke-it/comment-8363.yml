text: "What I do is keep both of you continually in prayer and I believe God heeds those prayers. I do not know how it works or what we remember. I know that God honors the prayers of parents for their children. <br/><br/>Micah saying these things right now have more to do with searching for his identity and not wanting to be labeled as a goody-goody and I'm trying to steer him away from that image, because he can be himself and God will accept him as he is. <br/><br/>The whole thing was important enough for Christ to give Heaven as a gift to anyone who wants it.<br/><br/>I thought about these things too at your age and still do. <br/><br/>God recognizes our love for others who are not believers and He loves them more even than we do. Christ came so that while we were still unbelievers He died for us.<br/><br/>There are some answers I struggle with, too, and I have learned that some things will not have answers. And that there are things we just don't know still. This is one thing that about drove me crazy for a while. And then God's peace came upon me about it. However, I pray God's protection for you and your brother every day. I know God is honoring this. And good things will happen."
