text: "Well I am right here with you now and I hope what I say helps but I am just not eloquent enough- but what I showed you was....   <br/><br/>(For the others of you, Google Duane Miller, and find the recording of his voice being healed while he was teaching. Pay attention to the miracle but also pay equal attention to what he was teaching at the time.)<br/><br/>God is faithful. I am trusting God for you and Micah and God loves those wonderful questioning college students looking at philosophies and he loves little teenage boys that skate around and listen to punk rock and smoke or don't smoke cigarettes in sheds, he loves drug addicts and prostitutes and rich oil barons and people in all countries no matter their class or caste and he loves people who are enslaved by addictions to pornography or alcohol or just regular people working and trying to be stable, he loves the goody goody people and the ones who are angry at him and those of any religion, and he even loves people that I don't love. I know we're not zombies after this life and I know that those who reject God are those who live in their chains, even though Christ has given us the key to unlock them. <br/>This man's teaching was reinforced by the miracle so that the miracle might not stop with one man but reach other people. Just a regular Sunday School curriculum put in place 6 years before it was taught. Notice he was also sick for exactly 3 years (3 being father/son/Holy ghost and also being the number of days between Christ's death and resurecction). Just a neat bonus that God put in there because He knows that numbers remind humans of things...God knows us. He really knows us. I know that there is so much that right now we are incapable of knowing and just cannot understand within our dimensions but God will show us many things, in time."
