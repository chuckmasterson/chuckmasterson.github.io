text: "Sounds like you have already made a huge step forward finding a rewarding job in the right kind of environment. Maybe the Cities will be the place to live and your &quot;out in the country&quot; will turn out to be a weekend cabin on a lake in the &quot;Wilderness&quot;. In any case you have made the right moves so far in your journey through &quot;A Good Life&quot;. Keep it up.  Uncle Chuck"
