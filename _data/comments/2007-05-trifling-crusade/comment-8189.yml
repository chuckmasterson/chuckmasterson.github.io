text: "Yes, my darling. Get employment! For my parents: He has his ap in at Border's.<br/><br/>About feet: Maybe that is why babies are allowed to go barefoot. I always thought it was stupid to put shoes on babies. Why? They don't walk! Now I realize it's because babies have just exceptionally cute feet. They are cuter than our feet. So when babies are carried barefoot into UDF, no one cares. But when we big folks go into UDF, our feet must be appropriately covered. Maybe it's just because they're kinda ugly. Though, Nathanael, your feet are purty because I'm your mom."
