text: "Heh, I was actually just looking around for other peoples' opinions on going barefoot in public as well as to find arguments to combat my parents. They're not keen on the idea of going barefoot at all. My mom wears shoes 80% of the time indoors and outdoors. It's crazy, I don't know how she does it!<br/><br/>It's starting to get warm again, so I'll be going barefoot outside again soon.<br/><br/>Sorry for the 2-month delay, I only do this occasionally when I'm bored. =-P"
