It was a wart, so I put wart remover pads on it. Now the wart is gone, but it's taking a long time to heal back over, so it looks pretty gross. I need to get some sort of Neosporin or something.

The Orthopedic Benefits of Going Barefoot are Well Documented Too, for what it's worth. Also, it's spelled parkour. It is French, but David Belle its originator decided to be unFrenchy about it. Like what I do with krokay."
