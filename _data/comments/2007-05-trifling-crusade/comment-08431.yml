text: "Hi!<br/>I've continued going barefoot, but toned it down significantly because of the winter (Grinnell tomorrow also has a forecast high of about 5). On a couple occasions, I've walked through the snow barefoot, a pretty incredible experience. Lately, I've drafted a Student Initiative to allow bare feet in the last holdout area on the campus, our dining hall. I'll be collecting signatures tomorrow; I need 100 by noon Saturday. Hopefully, I'll be able to actually accomplish my goal.When I interviewed the head honcho in the fall, he said he couldn't think of anything that would persuade him to repeal the footwear rule. Maybe if the majority of students tell him they think differently, he'll reconsider.<br/><br/>Incidentally, how did you end up here? That kind of thing always interests me."
