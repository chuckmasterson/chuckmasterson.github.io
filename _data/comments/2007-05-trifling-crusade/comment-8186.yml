text: "Aren't you the rebel, now.  My opinion is that feet are ugly.  Feet in sandals are still ugly.  Men's feet are especially ugly, usually.  I would prefer not to see them in or out of any public place except maybe the swimming pool.  I'm for shoes!  <br/><br/>Interesting that it isn't a law, though.  It ought to be.  Ha.  It's like in France.  You go into restaurants there and there are dogs all over the place, many of them in laps, being fed at the table.  No one cares there.  Don't know about shoes, though.  They probably would care about that.  Grandma  Oh, by the way.  That video about parkours scared me to death!  Don't get carried away with it.  I don't want to hear about broken bones."
