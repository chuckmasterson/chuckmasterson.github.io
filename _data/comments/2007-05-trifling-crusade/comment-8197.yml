text: "Don't worry.  I'll be in the van with MY bare feet.  Just let Grandpa try to kick ME out.  Ha.  But I'll wear my sandals in the restaurants and rest areas.  I don't want to pick up somebody else's crud.  And I hope we're about done with foot discussions.  Grandpa and I aren't sure exactly when and where to go on Thursday night.  How about a word to us?  Loved your invitation with all the hand done script.  I'm saving it forever.  Grandma"
