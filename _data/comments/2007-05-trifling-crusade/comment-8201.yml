text: "As I am sure, you're not particularly alone in this little crusade.  There was an incident at Brandeis my freshman year when a hippie decided to go barefoot everywhere and went into the school cafeteria.  The kindly cafeteria ladies did not take well to that statement of self-expression, and proceeded to toss him out on his butt.  If you pursue this to Grinnell, I hope you receive a much warmer reception.<br/><br/>BJ"
