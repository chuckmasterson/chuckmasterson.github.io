  I'm working on it. I've discovered that to write anything good, I usually need
  several undistracted hours to get into a groove. That much time is hard to
  come by on this trip, but I find it when I can. Someday I anticipate living on
  a farm that has a winter full of such hours. What else to do when everything
  is buried under three feet of snow and you've already fed the livestock and
  milked the cow?
