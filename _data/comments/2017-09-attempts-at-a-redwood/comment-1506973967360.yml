It'll be ironic if after all the prose I've written, the first thing of mine that goes into print outside my high school newspaper is one of the only poems I've ever written, but sometimes life is a little ironic. \r\n\r\nMy mom (above) has gotten poetry published before and she's also living in a place with stable postal and internet service, so she's going to help out on the communication end.\r\n\r\n**Mom**---*Spoon River Anthology* seems to be a [book from 1915][wsra], not a periodical. Is there a similar-named publication you're thinking of?\r\n\r\n[wsra]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoon_River_Anthology"
