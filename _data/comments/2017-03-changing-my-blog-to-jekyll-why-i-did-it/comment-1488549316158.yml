text: "Well, I have a few observations. The first and foremost- why anyone still uses Facebook is beyond me. I've never seen anything good happen because of Facebook. It certainly is the lowest hanging fruit on the tree of internet addictions. When I 'took my data back' from Facewaste, I had to 'schedule my account for deletion', which was a date no sooner than a full two weeks in the future. I'm convinced it's still out there. Somewhere. Anywhere. If I had the urge to fall off the wagon, I'm sure some codester at Wastebook could extract it from their equivalent to Area 51.\r\n\r\nYes google doesn't care about internet posterity, but the shares I bought last year for $725/share are now at $850, so that's full of win. Someday I'll cash out and buy a cabin on a lake. I won't be off the grid, but my cellphone will be at the bottom of the lake, it's a recurring dream that will come true someday.\r\n\r\nI hope this creaky code you're talking about is better in airplanes, my latest ride is fly by wire. No electric mechanical backup. Just ones, zeroes and a joystick. All fly by wire airplanes have backups. I have lots of electrical sources: three generators, four batteries, and a ram air turbine emergency generator. If my fly by wire code is corrupted, there is a second system, standing by, ready to take over. The second system doesn't talk to the first system and is written in a different computer language or perhaps it's a code. It's PFM(pure f*cking magic) to us Luddites up front, but it hasn't failed yet! It is newer, better and safer than the old junk that was around when people blogged. Ha!"
