text: "Hey Nathanael,<br />What did you think of the math quiz?<br />Marching does look pretty hard.  Ms. Johnson had us march around while playing our violins the other day, and we were about ready to cry.  Especially since we marched past the end of the pit, and the big hole in the stage just loomed right next to you.  We all almost fell.  I am quite contented to fiddle with my butt in my chair.  Well anywho good luck at the contest and tell us how it goes.<br />Rosie"
