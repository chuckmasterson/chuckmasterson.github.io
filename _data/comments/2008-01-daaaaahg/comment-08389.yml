text: "Blackie, the dog we had when Steve and Tom were boys, was half wire-haired terrier and half beagle.  Not quite the same as Fly, and didn't look like what you describe, but perhaps similar in some characteristics.  She weighed about 20 pounds until she got too fat and went up to 25 pounds.  At that point we had to put her on a diet to get her back to 20 pounds.<br/><br/>Her worst attribute was that she ran away at every opportunity and wouldn't come back for hours, if then.  I hope Fry fairs better in that area.<br/><br/>Aunt E."
