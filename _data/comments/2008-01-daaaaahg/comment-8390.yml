text: "Ellen & Chuck,<br/><br/>I remember Blackie, and I quite vividly remember my cat Blaze teasing her by sitting just at the edge of where her leash reached. <br/><br/>This dog is getting along with our cats. Tom (the cat) is no longer afraid or defensive and Gigi is getting used to roaming the house while Fry is being noisy. Of course Weasel sleeps about 20 hours a day and as long as she's under her blanket she doesn't care who is making noise. We're not Debbie but we do have our own little zoo.<br/><br/>Steve works with polar bears every weekend and used to work with manatees, penguins, etc. etc. etc., quite a bit, so we're getting used to, well, animals in general.<br/><br/>I used to be so anti-dog-in-the-house, but now with Micah REALLY taking care of Fry, he is learning love and responsibility for another creature besides himself.  And a dog is a bit needier of companionship than a cat. He won't be able to just leave Fry for long times because Fry will miss him. I am just praying this whole dog thing keeps going as well as has been.<br/><br/>Mom"
