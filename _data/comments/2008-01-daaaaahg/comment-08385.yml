text: "Oh, my, there is no hope...for this dog...in your eyes. The dog is primarily Micah's. By the time you are gone he will probably be trained. I did not want a cutesy dog- I wanted a dog for Micah. And he will grow to be 30 pounds only. Karl does not know what he's talking about. He is a medium-sized dog. As soon as he is completely trained, he will not be in a cage when we're out, but more likely in the basement room, in a doghouse, whatever. The dog is Micah. Actually I have taken it on walks and Tom goes along. Today Tom and Fry did make friends. And I have paid no less attention to Gigi than normal. And your dad is being very devoted to Weasel. He's had her out several times, including now. :) Please don't condemn the dawg yet.<br/>Mom"
