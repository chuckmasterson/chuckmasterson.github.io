text: "Nathanael - The dog can't be ugly.  ALL dogs are cute in their own way.  Stinky he can be, though, and Micah can bathe him so you can have him on your bed.  But what will Fry do when you go back to Grinnell?  Hope they have thought up a plan for that, short of Micah playing hooky from school.  I can't wait to see Fry.  I'll bet he's just like a little baby--needs attention all the time and stinks if you don't clean him up.  But very much loved all the same.  Love, Grandma"
