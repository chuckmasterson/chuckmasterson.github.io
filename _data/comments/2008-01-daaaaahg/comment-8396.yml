text: "When Nathanael goes back to Grinnell, I will still come home at lunch to walk him (as I have been doing). Once he is older, he will be able to hold for a while but when I can I will come home. He goes out in the morning 2x, lunch, several times in the afternoon and evening. Potty training is going well. He is a smart dog. 2 smart breeds. When he's older he will have a piddle pad in case of accidents. Right now he just chews those up. But so far so good as long as he goes out often and gets lots of playtime and exercise.<br/><br/>Ann"
