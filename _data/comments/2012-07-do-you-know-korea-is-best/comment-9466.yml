text: "PS Hmmmmm, Dave....I like American individualism....having experienced it, I could never go back to monotonous conformity. Bleah. Japan is very conformist, too, and I LOVE LOVE LOVE Japan but I could never live like the majority of them live, always worrying about what the neighbors think, being shocked at American tattoos, everything being so ridiculously cute, etc. Colombians are conformists, too, though there&#39;s more of a subculture. Lived there, loved it, but had to have my independence. <br />Ann"
