text: "Chile is the same way. It&#39;s a more romantic latin america flavor but you see it in the television programming and in the people too. The population is much more homogenous, no subculture, or sub-subculture out in the open. No ink, piercings, anarchy etc. All of those things come later. I kind of find it refreshing. In the western world everyone is out to profess how &#39;individual&#39; they are and if you don&#39;t take notice and praise autonomy addicts accordingly you will regret it somehow.<br /><br />Dave"
