text: "Grandma—Sounds like it&#39;s a universal theme that it&#39;s up to the young to let go of the grudges of the old. It gives hope.<br /><br />Dave—Huh! I never thought too much about what Chilean culture might be like, but I guess I figured it was probably sort of a raucous wonderful free-for-all melting pot. I guess I&#39;m projecting what little I know of Brazil (and what I know is probably not very correct) onto the rest of the continent.<br /><br />Grandpa—I haven&#39;t really heard women golfers mentioned much. To be honest, probably the majority of sports recognition in the country goes to one man—Park Ji-Sung. Whenever we play a game that needs a picture of a celebrity, Park Ji-Sung is kind of the default person. It gets kind of old. But I guess he&#39;s probably even more tired of the cult around him."
