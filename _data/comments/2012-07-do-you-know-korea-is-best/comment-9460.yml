text: "Interesting stuff you write.  I&#39;d have to say, though, that the Germans are still hated by lots of French, especially in Alsace.  There they are referred to as &quot;casques pointus&quot;, or pointy helmets.  It&#39;s the old ones who are still like that.  We once went to Ste. Mere Eglise in Normandy, and while we were at the church we watched a German high school band playing underneath the steeple.  The kids certainly didn&#39;t care.  They were having lots of fun doing it.  They probably didn&#39;t even know that there was a famous battle there.  Grandma"
