text: "I don&#39;t intend to rely on hitchhiking. To me trainhopping is way preferable, because you don&#39;t have to ask permission (in fact, not asking permission is kind of the point, although there are occasional times when a conductor will let you ride in an unoccupied locomotive if it&#39;s cold or he&#39;s feeling generous). I know it can be dangerous, and that&#39;s why I&#39;d take every possible precaution if it ended up being avoidable: probably no rides from semis, look unthreatening but be ready to defend myself, and such. Hopefully I won&#39;t end up in hitchhiking situations much. <br /><br />Congratulations on your new job! It&#39;s been a long time coming, but you&#39;ve finally got it.<br /><br />Also, if I end up going to Japan, I want to check out the Sapporo Snow Festival (札幌雪祭り). It looks like one of the most awesome things ever for someone interested in snow sculpture. For those of you who haven&#39;t seen it on Facebook, yesterday I built a whale out of snow. It&#39;s life-size, and surfacing in the middle of the campus&#39;s central field. It made me achy all over, but I&#39;ll take pictures sometime when I&#39;m less exhausted and before it becomes shapeless, and post them here."
