text: "My load of gear will consist of one backpack. Yes, it&#39;s hard to get around the US without a car of your own, but I think by going without I&#39;ll get a lot more personal sense of the scale of this country. A landscape will seem more real from the seat of a bicycle or from the porch of a grain car. <br /><br />Incidentally, I was told the other day about a program called CELTA, which is something like &quot;Certificate for English Language Teaching Awesomeness&quot;, but with a different word at the end. The way I understand it is you get accredited through this, and then you can go most non-English-speaking places on the planet and someone will invite you to teach English and pay you for it. I&#39;m still planning to do JET, but if I ever decide to do the CELTA thing, Europe may be a possibility as well. Who knows?"
