text: "I did all of those things, except: the shoes weren&#39;t polished, just black; I took a shower instead of a bath; and I didn&#39;t shave entirely, just tidied up. I think the interview went about as well as I could have expected it to, especially since it&#39;s my first real interview with a real company. I stalled a few times, but I think I generally conveyed a pretty good impression. The only thing is that the internship isn&#39;t quite what I&#39;d expectedâ€”it&#39;s mainly proofreading, and not really any design. I can deal with that, but I think I&#39;m also going to ask the guys who founded Press where they did their internships. Those seem to have given them a pretty broad overview of everything to do with publishing. But they also might have happened somewhere in New York City, which would be pricy. Possibly I could stay with them, because I think they&#39;re still living there. If I get offered the internship that I just interviewed for, can I accept it and then back out if I get a different one? Seems risky. I wish I&#39;d looked at other internships sooner instead of putting all my eggs in this basket, but I didn&#39;t have any time for that, and I forgot about the lead that I had in the founders."
