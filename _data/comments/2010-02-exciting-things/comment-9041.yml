text: "It all sounds too fun! If I could rewind the clock, I would go train hopping too. Hitchhiking is probably not as hazardous as one might think. People seem to think that this generation invented kidnapping, violence, things like that. Kids of a young age used to run about cities and countries un-abated in the days before local and national scare you to death news. I would bet money that the rates of crime hitchhiking have not changed much in 100 years. It just gets reported and sensationalized, and we react, clinging to an imagined improved safety.<br /><br />Ecuador is a good cheap place to be. I have heard it has a sizable US retiree population. 20k a year in the US is poverty. 20k a year in Ecuador is a house and staff to boot. Stay away from the Colombian border and you will be fine. They have the best shrimp in the world too!<br /><br />I say go for it! <br /><br />Dave"
