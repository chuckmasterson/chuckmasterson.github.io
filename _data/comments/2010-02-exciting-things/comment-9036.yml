text: "Glad to hear you have an interview in Chicago!  Way to go!  We&#39;ll be pulling for you, all the way from Arizona. <br /><br />I also remember feeling the same way about college at just about this same time during my junior year.  The end is in sight but too far away to seem real.  The feeling lasted a couple of weeks and then I got back on track for the rest of the semester.<br /><br />Aunt E."
