text: "Your semester off sounds great!  I would suggest that one weekend this summer or sometime you have a couple of days to burn, you should try traveling with your load of gear without your car.  I suspect you will find that your adventure may turn out to be a constant search for transportation, costing you precious time for more interesting things. I just know that transportation in the U.S. is pro-car. ALL other modes are cumbersome at best. If you want to take a real adventure without a car I have one word for you - EUROPE!"
