  Never met Kevy, that I can remember. I had a feeling the story wouldn't gather
  much interest, printed like that... probably got mistaken for a misplaced
  school assignment. "Who wants to read some college kid's attempt at creative
  writing?" (Yes, some people, but not many.) I've done a few revisions and made
  a nice-layout version, but it seems like if I sent you that to leave at the
  Black Cat it'd be forcing the whole thing too much. Maybe I can send you one
  of my copies of *Into the Ruins* instead.
