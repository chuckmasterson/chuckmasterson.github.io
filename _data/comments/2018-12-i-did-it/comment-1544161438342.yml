  peregrination... like the peregrine falcon? The plant sweet fern is Comptonia
  peregrina... hm! I handed your story to Kevy at the Black Cat (not sure you
  met the kind and Aquarian Ashland fellow... that means a dreamer! full of
  ideas) and he read a little before he had to go, a placed it on the book
  shelf, and a few days later I saw it in the lost and found, so it seems it was
  not accepted as common property. However it's in safe keeping until I find
  someone worthy of handing it off to... or I can sell it MWAHAHA
