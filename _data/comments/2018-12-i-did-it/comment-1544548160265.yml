  P.S. *peregrinus* in Latin meant someone from outside Roman territory (beyond
  the fields: *per agri*), and after a while it started to mean someone who's on
  a long journey. Under that meaning it came to us both directly in
  "peregrination" and indirectly through the garbling of centuries as "pilgrim".
  (I didn't know all that off the top of my head, only half or so, in case you
  were wondering.)
