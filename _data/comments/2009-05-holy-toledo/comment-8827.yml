text: "Thanks, Nathanael!<br /><br />I asked at the registration desk and they had the books right there for me!  <br /><br />I'll show them to some of the alums from our class.  I haven't had time to read them yet, but both of them look great!  You obviously worked hard and did a good job with them.<br /><br />We are staying in Rathje Hall!  Seems funny to be here so soon after seeing you here.  It is so different with the students gone.  In fact, so far we are the only people on the 2nd floor.  The real reunion starts tomorrow, so the place will fill up with old timers.  <br /><br />The alumni college has been interesting.  This morning we had a class on the Dead Sea Scrolls and the various histories of different versions of the Bible.<br /><br />Thanks again!<br /><br />Aunt E."
