text: "I left them with the Information Desk person (in the Joe Rosenfield Center). There aren't any on display, so those are the only ones they'll be able to get to. They should find whoever's manning the desk and ask for books that were left for Ellen Herring. If there's no one at the infomation desk, I don't know. See if anyone—possibly someone from Facilities Maintenance—knows how to get into the desk. (They keep it locked, I'm guessing.)"
