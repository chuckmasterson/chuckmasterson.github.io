text: "I am so happy for you that you got there safe and sound, with all parts intact, well, except maybe for the skin on your heel.  PLEASE be careful on bikes!!!!  I am cheering you on as you have adventure after adventure.  If you are open minded for interesting things to happen, they do, I&#39;ve always found when I travel.  Just like the man you sat with on the train, and he helped you out later.  I love that.<br /><br />I admire your confidence in being able to reject a novel.  You know when it&#39;s not good, but the writer sure doesn&#39;t or he wouldn&#39;t have submitted it.  And you have to be the one to say the truth.  I would guess that for every publishable, actually good novel, there are a thousand that probably should not have been written.  That&#39;s too bad.  Let me know if you run into any manuscripts that are really good.  Grandma"
