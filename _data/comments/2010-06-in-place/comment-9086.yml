text: "I&#39;ve spend plenty of time on the subways, late at night, wandering around Manhattan, Brooklyn, Central Park, and never felt in danger. I suggest all of the obvious explorations- the world trade center site, Battery park and a trip to lady liberty, Central park, grand central station. All can be done for dirt cheap on the subways, or better yet just walking. I&#39;ve walked from central park to battery park, fun stuff! I&#39;m jealous again.<br /><br />Dave"
