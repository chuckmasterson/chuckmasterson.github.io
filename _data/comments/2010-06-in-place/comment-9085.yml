text: "I never told you that you would be swallowed whole by the city.  I simply said look out for the girls with Adam&#39;s apples.  I have several friends that have gone to live there and they were fine.  Just a little common sense is a must.<br /><br />I hope you get to try all those great establishments, but I suspect with your budget, if you do, you’ll be broke in 3 weeks. I’d wager that or you’re gonna be eating noodles at home a lot.<br /><br />My NY City tip of the day (or more likely of the year) is: if you need to pull out a map to find your way, just step into a store or restaurant where you’re less obvious."
