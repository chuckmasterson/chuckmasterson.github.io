text: "Great way to learn about the world in all its variations!  You are seeing things at the gathering that will shape your mind in the future--gathering story ideas and experience to make them believable.  More power to you--well, unless you did some illegal stuff like hard drugs or something.<br /><br />As for having a summer with no work--you really hardly have time, with Crow Duck in the middle.  Consider that you&#39;ve been hired to be our errand man in Crow Duck and that we need you for kid chasing and heavy lifting--it&#39;s true, and then you can feel you are working.  And if you also get to fish, while being a very needed boat driver, then that&#39;s gravy.<br /><br />Someday you will look on this last &quot;free&quot; summer with great happiness.  You&#39;ve got the rest of your life to wear a ball and chain.  Grandma"
