text: "Ok Dustin Hoffman, isn&#39;t there an oversexed 40 something housewife in the neighborhood with too much time on her hands? Just kidding.<br /><br />You have already found that a gathering of a bunch of people with no purpose in mind will end poorly. Nothing wrong with a good party, or celebration, but it is not the means to an end, and certainly not &#39;the end&#39; itself. A celebration with no purpose rings hollow. We are all searching for something, but I don&#39;t believe emptying out the vagaries or our conscience, putting our &#39;inner weirdness&#39; on display is anything but an exercise in mutual conceited laziness on an endless search for external validation.<br /><br />Someday you will look back and realize that you got burned, at the burn.<br /><br />Dave"
