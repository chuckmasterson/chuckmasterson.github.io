text: "I agree with Toy.  Anyone can complain, but you have to be willing to do something for it to change.  I would suggest checking the local news websites to see how you can submit a story.  Try cincinnati.com channelcincinnati.com wxix.com and wkrc.com.  You could also try submitting to the Enquirer, Post, or even the Hilltop.  In fact, I'm positive your word would get out if you just slipped me an article for the school paper...<br /><br />P.S.  I left a couple posts on your last two entries as well.  You should check those :)"
