text: "That is an excellent letter.  Now, if you want real results be sure to take it public.  Make a grassroots movement to preserve the park in its natual state.  <br /><br />Not only can you capitalize on the beauty of the park itself but the underfunding of public schools.  <br /><br />Places to raise support:<br />editorial of the paper<br />local TV news agencies - ours here in Colorado love news tips and young activists.<br />Find an evironmentalist group to help support this and lobby it to the correct governing person<br />or find that person yourself.<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is if you expect something to happen then you will have to go beyond just one letter.<br /><br />Toy (your second cousin-in-law)"
