text: "Well my son is pretty much bilingual now. Esperanto baffles me but I know it shouldn't since it does make so much sense. I guess I just can't bring myself to learn a language that was actually developed by logic rather than centuries of lingual mergers via wars, agriculture, migration, alliances, conquests, and general pillaging and mayhem, the way all other human languages have developed. Has my son found the pre-diasporan Babel builders?"
