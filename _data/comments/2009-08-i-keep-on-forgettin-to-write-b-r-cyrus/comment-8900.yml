text: "You can bake wonderful things with baseball bat sized zucchinis.  Hope you have figured that out, because you can&#39;t eat them plain, and I suppose it would be against all the rules to waste it.  <br /><br />Glad you are enjoying this year at school.  And I encourage going to parties and getting to know kids better.  After all, that&#39;s part of the school experience, too.  Sounds like your GOOP experience was a lot of fun, too.  <br /><br />Grandpa and I are leaving for Egypt in twelve days, but I&#39;m going to try to get some ginger snaps sent before we leave.  You can&#39;t give those up.  Grandma"
