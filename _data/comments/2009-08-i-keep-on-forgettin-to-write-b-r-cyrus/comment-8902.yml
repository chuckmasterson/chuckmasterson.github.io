text: "I knew what GOOP stood for and that you&#39;d done it before...I was just funnin&#39;. And don&#39;t feel so bad about eating meat. I know you want your meat to be happy before you eat it and when you get back home we can get meat at the Farmer&#39;s Market. Their meat is very happy before it&#39;s clubbed. Last night Karl cooked us barbecue manwich-y things. Very meaty.<br /><br />I tell you I could do without meat forever- I like a lot of vegetarian stuff myself- but since it&#39;s here and it&#39;s good I eat it. I love you and think about you.<br />MOM"
