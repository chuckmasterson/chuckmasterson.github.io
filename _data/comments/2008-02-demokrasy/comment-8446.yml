text: "Smoking us for a one-day total, yes. And that blizzard you're getting would be pretty awesome here too. But recall: the hue field in the middle of campus here hasn't seen daylight at all since sometime in December. Whereas this is the first really good snow for you all winter. So I'm not too glum about it. But I encourage you to enjoy."
