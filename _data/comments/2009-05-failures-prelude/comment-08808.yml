text: "Tell em' all to stick it. Grinnell is an earth muffin target rich enviornment. I suggest you get more involved in extra-cirricular activites and shamelessly hit on some said muffins. Relax and have a beer if you want. Being social and having a drink does not make you a party guy. Nobody likes a prude just as nobody likes a drunk.<br /><br />You are smart, good looking, honest and wise. These traits may not ammount to much with feckless co-eds, but as time rolls on you will feel like a twinkie being chased by a hoard of fat kids. Trust me on that.<br /><br />Dave"
