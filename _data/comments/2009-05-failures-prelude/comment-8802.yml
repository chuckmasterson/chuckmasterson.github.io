text: "You are making it more difficult than it needs to be.  After my first semi-serious girlfriend dumped me, I decided \"screw it, I'm just going to talk to more girls and ask them out\".  It worked.  I went out with a number of girls in a matter of a couple of months.  It was great.  then Tracy came along and the fun got even better.  When I decided to be more loose in approaching women I realized that they liked it when men hit on them.  I realized this mostly because I was never turned down. Including Tracy.<br /><br />There's my 2 cents.  I'll understand if you give me back some change.<br /><br />Dan"
