text: "A chance.  At Grinnell.  Probably.  But someday the girl will want to take their primate home to Mom and Dad for show and tell.  Then what?  Some Chance. A little Chance. A big chance. NO!  No chance.  Mom's and Dad's do not want their daughters, beau to shed on the carpet.  <br /><br />All is well as long as you never leave Grinnell.  However, when you do leave, well................you fill in the blanks.  So when it is show and tell time - the big break up occurs.  No takeeee home.   Ask a girl about this and see if they think I'm right??? Which of course I am.  G.Pa.    P.S.  Old ways are the right ways."
