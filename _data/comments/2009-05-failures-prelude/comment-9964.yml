text: "It just occurred to me that I may be somewhere in your blog and decided to investigate. I&#39;m sorry if this is creepy. I was weirdly happy when I saw that I was there. I just wanted to say that it was a mistake, my rejection of you, and it was a result of two things that were going on in my life: I was on an anti-depressant at the time for anxiety which made me less anxious but also made me not care about anything, include how I made other people feel... and I still had a lot of maturing to do. You are a VERY special person, left a nice big foot-shaped mark on my soul, and most of all, you were right: we do have an AWFUL lot in common. I haven&#39;t found anyone who has more in common with me than you so far in life. I think about this often, and about what could have been, Nathanael. I read some of your most recent blogs, and your life seems fantastic. I wish that I could live with people who earnestly try to be good to the earth and do a meal share. In most of the USA there isn&#39;t a real sense of community left. It leaves a numbing, plasticky taste in the mouth."
