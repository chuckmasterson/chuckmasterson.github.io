Yes there are differences, regarding expectations relative to males and females, e.g., females are expected to have children and males are expected to pay for them.  However, if you are really lucky and can find a rich female primate you can have them do both, i.e. bear them and pay for them both.  That's my story and I am stickin' to it.   G.Pa"
