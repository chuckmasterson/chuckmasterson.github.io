text: "We are getting ready to leave for Crow Duck.  Will be driving out of here Tuesday morning to get there by Friday afternoon.  Sure am going to miss you.  Barefoot, gloved, whatever.  You.  I didn't even make any ginger cookies this year, and I don't know who will drink all the hot cocoa, either.  But I guess you won't lose your hard earned money to Dan the poker machine, anyway.  We will be thinking of you and hoping you are enjoying your summer, even without a Crow Duck in it.  Love, Grandma"
