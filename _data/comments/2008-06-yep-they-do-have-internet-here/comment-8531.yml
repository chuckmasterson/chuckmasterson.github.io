text: "Okay, break this argument Mr. Smartypants.  You are in charge of a group of kids who are depending on you to lead them through tough terrain and winding rivers.  If you accidentally cut open one of your feet and cannot perform your job, you have jeopardized the health and safety of those you are protecting.  You can't successfully argue that it is less likely to have a serious foot injury without shoes on.<br/>The camp policy is clearly a good one, with no exceptions.  The policy protects their workers, attendees and the camp's reputation as being safe and that my friend is a major part of running a camp.<br/><br/>Stick that in your hat and smoke it!<br/><br/>Dan"
