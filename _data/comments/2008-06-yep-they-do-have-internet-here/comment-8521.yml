text: "No Bonnells? So does that mean Micah's grades did end up being too bad for Dad to let him go along?<br/>I was thinking the other day that after I get my driver's license this summer maybe I'll write a letter to Bill again and see if he's looking for any help. I wrote one a few years ago, and when I got there that summer he said not really, and that it would probably be complicated what with my not living in Canada. But he probably was avoiding telling me that I was underqualified (since Danny is from Florida, if I recall). If I have a license, and some experience at a broadly similar place of employment, maybe he'll consider it a bit longer.<br/>But if not, I'm definitely going to go to Crowduck next year. I'm not sure yet whether I'll work here next year, but one thing that has bothered me and that I won't be able to change is the shoe requirement. Manito-wish has a positively phobic attitude toward bare feet. Basically, you must have shoes on at all times, except when you're in an enclosed place that can be slept in (residential cabins, tents). I feel like I'm missing a good portion of the outdoor experience by keeping my shoes on, because it deprives me of the sense I have that can most intimately connect me to the outdoors. With shoes on, I feel perpetually insulated. Unfortunately, that sort op hifalutin philosophizing stuff isn't going to stand up to their 90-year-old policy of \"Kids might cut themselves, and that's not good, so you have to wear close-toed shoes every minute you're outside.\" I've caught minutes where I can, to foot through the pine needles, but really, when fun is covert like that it's extremely diminished. So, I'll see over the next month here whether the fun stuff going on here can counteract that sufficiently. I'll tell you when I get back to Cincinnati whether or not I'll come back here next year, and that way, if you see fit to schedule Crowduck around me, you'll have the information you need to do that (or not do it, depending on my decision)."
