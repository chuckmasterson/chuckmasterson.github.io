text: "I think if I saw Grandpa in a tutu it would bring on a heart attack.  That or I would die laughing.  Let's not put him in one.  However, I agree.  Don't knock tutus on the right people--thin and female, that is.  I am glad you will have such a great time at your job.  Better than standing in the prep line at McDonalds all summer, or digging ditches, or even standing behind a cash register in a supermartket, which is what I did in the summers.  Enjoy!  Grandma"
