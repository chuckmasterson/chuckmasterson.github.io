text: "Actually, Lake Delton did not break through where its dam was.  The dam held.  It broke through in another area, crossed some roads, and essentially emptied out.<br/><br/>Cedar Rapids and Des Moines, Iowa, have been devastated with flooding, as has much more of Iowa.  Grinnell has not been in the news, fortunately.  Davenport also has been hit, including Duck Creek, near Alice's house.  They had 1/2 inch of water in their basement.  <br/><br/>Chuck and I are in Oregon (Beaverton) staying with our 2 grandchildren while Steve and Cindy are going rafting in Idaho for a week.  We'll get home just in time for me to go to Crowduck.  Hooray!<br/><br/>(Unless OUR basement is flooded when we get home!  We did have one puddle before we left!)<br/><br/>Glad you're enjoying your summer job!<br/><br/>Aunt E."
