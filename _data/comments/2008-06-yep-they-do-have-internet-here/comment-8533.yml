text: "All right, I will, Dan!<br/><br/>If I accidentally cut open my hand and can't perform my job, I've jeopardized their health and safety, too... yet, they don't require that we wear protective leather gloves. There's always some risk inherent in going on an outdoor trip, or for that matter in living at all. So it's all about where you draw the line for what safety equipment you need. Manito-wish draws theirs pretty high. But I think there would be pretty little risk in letting kids go barefoot in the campsites. <br/>Incidentally, the closest I came to a big injury may have been when I slipped down a steep hill because my shoes were slippery. I doubt I would have fallen with the sure grip of bare feet.<br/><br/>Stick that in your pipe and call it macaroni!<br/><br/>P.S. I just got back from a five-day trip, and tomorrow I leave on another. Blog to probably follow tonight."
