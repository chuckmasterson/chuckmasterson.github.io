text: "But we're talking specifically about Grandpa here. Which maybe we shouldn't do, in connection to tutus.<br/><br/>We haven't had any problems with flooding here - instead, it's just really good paddling with little walking. I was amazed by the Manitowish River when I saw it - at an irrigation pump for a cranberry bog, the water was five or six feet higher than it was last year. 'Course, last year was an extreme drought. However, did you hear about Lake Delton, in the Wis Dells? It busted its dam, and now it's just a river."
