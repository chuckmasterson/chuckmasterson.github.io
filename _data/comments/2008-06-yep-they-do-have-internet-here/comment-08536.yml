Just carry your own needle and string in case you need to stitch up one of your feet. <br/><br/>I say life isn't safe. Go barefoot, but only if you don't get caught.<br/><br/>Maybe you could get mediation and settle on socks only. Life is full of compromise....ha ha!<br/><br/>Bust out yo 9, da likka stow be robbed!..........<br/><br/>Dave"
