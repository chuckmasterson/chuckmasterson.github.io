text: "You can still hike with a cut hand. To avoid slipping I would get a good pair of hiking boots, I suggest Merrell.<br/><br/>I don't care what you conceive as a good argument, there is no contest between bare feet and shoes as far a safety goes.  I agree that the policy about the kids may be a bit over the top, but for you as a counselor and especially going on hiking trips every day.  Shoes are a must.<br/><br/>Stick that in your boot and squish it.<br/><br/>We’ll miss you up in CD.  I’m sure you were looking forward to a little “rob da licka stow” but it can wait until next year.<br/><br/>Dan"
