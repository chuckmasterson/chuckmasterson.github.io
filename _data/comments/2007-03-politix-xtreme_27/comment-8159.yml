text: "Al made a lot of great points and in no way do I think we should ignore global warming and just continue to do what we do. There is evidence that solar flares are at least partially responsible for some of it, but I believe the biggest responsibility is deforestation, and people have known it for decades. That was the reason I was given in Dakar for the years-long drought- deforestation to the southeast. It is also responsible for the encroachment of the Sahara. Timbuktu was a thriving metropolis a couple thousand years ago and now it is a dustpit. The US would do well to remember its dust bowl and the environmental damage it did, though it was for the most part reversible. <br/>What I didn't like was how old Al set himself up as kind of a demigod over a rapt audience. I can see the egoism-age tends to dim the light on those idolatries.<br/>Al profits from a zinc-mining company, uses tons of electricity APART from his travel expenses, etc. He discredits himself by not practicing what he preaches and seems to have a savior complex, the same that allowed him to say \"I facilitated the invention of the internet\". <br/><br/>That in no way detracts from the very clear and present danger our planet faces.<br/><br/>-Mom"
