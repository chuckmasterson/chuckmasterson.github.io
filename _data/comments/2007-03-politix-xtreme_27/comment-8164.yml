text: "Congrats on getting into Grinell. I feel for you and your political struggle. Thankyou for seeing shades of Gray. So many people(Rush) see only what they want to see. Al Gore is the same way. I thnk Gore is right for the most part but anyone who can't borrow opinion, fact or otherwise from the \"opposition\" is blind to their own prejudice. I can't stand blind partisan republicrats or demublicans. I'm convinced most people NEED to be right to bolster their self esteem. The arguement or point of view is less important than WINNING the arguement. Being impartial is far less rewarding than being right.<br/><br/>Dave"
