text: "Hey chief,<br/><br/>Yeah, politics is just another word for predisposition.  In Cincinnati, 70% of Hamilton County is Republican.  As a Democrat growing up in Finneytown, it was often frustrating that no one would listen, even when the facts were plainly against their beliefs.  I was sad to discover that upon arriving in Massachusetts, the people here are just as blindly prejudiced, except against Republicans.  The people of Massachusetts think of Republicans probably the same way your father seems to think about Democrats.  They look down on people who believe in God the same way many people in Ohio look down on those who don't.  I came to the conclusion that people are people, and no matter their political persuasion, give them a reason to dislike someone, and they will.<br/><br/>As for your colleges, I'm sorry to hear you didn't get in.  There's no two ways about it; its just plain disappointing. <br/><br/>Anywho, on the upside, you're out of Finneytown in just two months!<br/><br/>Hope to hear from you soon,<br/><br/>BJ"
