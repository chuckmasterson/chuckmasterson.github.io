text: "Glad you had fun on your birthday, and glad I could be a part of it.   I'm sorry you didn't get the answers you wanted from two schools, but never fear.  You will do well wherever you go, especially with the logical thinking and solid reasoning you show in the first part of your entry.  Hooray for clear thinking.  May you keep developing your own way.  Aunt Irene has a story about that, something our Dad told us once.  Sometime I'll tell it to you.  But not here, since it would take too long.  Love, Grandma"
