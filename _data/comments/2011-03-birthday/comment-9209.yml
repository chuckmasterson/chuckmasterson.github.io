text: "Nathanael,<br /><br />Aunt E writing here.<br /><br />You recently mentioned thinking of going to China after graduation.  I don&#39;t know if you are serious or not, but I asked my neighbor across the street in Cary if she had any advice for you.  Her son Tim went to China expecting to teach English after he graduated from college, and for him it was a disaster.  Here are her comments for you:<br /><br /> As far as your great nephew&#39;s plans to go to China....there are a few things that I think are key factors for success:<br /><br />    *  it might be good to go with a very good friend for companionship<br /><br />   *  there are &#39;marketing&#39; companies that will try to recruit people to teach English.  Your great nephew might ask if the marketing company will reimburse for airfare if they do not provide a teaching job within a certain amount of time.  Tim interviewed at several schools, many of them elementary, and did not get hired.  He was put up in a little hotel room that was filled with mold/mildew that collected on his personal belongings and clothes.<br /><br />   *  one of the marketing women told me that Tim was the least independent candidate they had.  They would line up job interviews for Tim and at times he would not go alone.  Tim told me that it would be like getting on a train in Cary, traveling into Chicago, switching trains etc. and ending up on the south side of Chicago------without understanding the language.  He wouldn&#39;t be able to ask for help.  The marketing co. said they would give him a sign with the destination written on it, and he could show it to people to get help traveling to the different job interviews.<br /><br />   * they usually wanted a 2 year commitment from the English speaking teacher.  In Tim&#39;s case, he was frustrated because he didn&#39;t have a teaching job yet, got ESL certified and decided to go.  I was worried very much because he recently had been diagnosed with diabetes and had started taking insulin shots just 6 weeks before he went.  We sent Tim off with a new laptop computer so that he could e-mail us.  He said it was the biggest mistake of his life (after 5 weeks) and wanted to come home.  <br /><br />   *if your grand nephew is very independent, brave and not concerned about feeling alone, it might be a good experience for him.  I feel bad for the kids getting out of college now.....not a great outlook for jobs here.  China is certainly the up and coming nation.  Maybe he&#39;ll have a fantastic experience.  It would be good if he could talk with others who have gone and just recently come back."
