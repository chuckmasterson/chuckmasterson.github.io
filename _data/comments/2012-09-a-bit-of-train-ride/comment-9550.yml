I am so thrilled that you camped at Lake Baikal.  <br /><br />Your sleeping bag arrived today and it&#39;s going to go into my suitcase.  That means I&#39;ll have room to put souvenirs for the trip home.  Ha.<br /><br />Grandpa says you got to Auschwitz and I&#39;m pleased about that, too.  Grandma"
