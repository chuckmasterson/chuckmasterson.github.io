text: "Update: after hearing about a book called <i>The Jungle Effect</i>, whose author studies five different cultures around the world that are outstandingly healthy and finds drastic differences in their diets, with just a few commonalities (like freshness, seasonality, and synergy), I&#39;ve decided to say heck with it, I&#39;ll eat whatever I want, as long as it&#39;s fresh and/or free. Sometime I&#39;ll read a copy of that book and some other books  <i>then</i> I&#39;ll start figuring out what kind of stuff I&#39;ll eat day to day."
