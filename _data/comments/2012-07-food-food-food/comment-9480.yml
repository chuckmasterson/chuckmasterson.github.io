text: "Since you will soon be leaving Korea, I want to let you know about Portugal.    We should be arriving in Lisbon sometime in the afternoon of Oct. 20, according to our brochure.  The brochure also says that we&#39;ll be staying at Hotel Mundial, Lisbon.  It does say that on some trips an alternate hotel could be used, so this information is not set in stone.  <br /><br />We will be getting a final package of info from the touring company, Grand Circle, at least two or three weeks before we leave on Oct. 9.  In that, the hotel information will be confirmed.<br /><br />I guess this means that at some time before we meet, you should try to contact us or your mother (we&#39;ll give her the info) to firm up the hotel we&#39;ll be in.  <br /><br />We&#39;re really looking forward to seeing you there.  Lisbon is a fun city.  We should be able to find lots to do.<br /><br />Good luck on your coming travels, and remember that you will be going to places that can be dangerous.  Yes, most everyone you meet is helpful, but there are nasties in Russia, and I can confirm that personally.  Brush up on your Russian--at least remember how to say get lost in Russian.  Hopefully, the slang, not very nice way to say it.  Grandma"
