text: "As it happens, the thing about hunter-gatherers living only to their 20s is a persistent misconception. When people quote a low number like that, it&#39;s almost guaranteed to be factoring in the fairly high rates of child mortality that hunter-gatherer societies often have. If you get through childhood fine, though, you have outstanding odds of living a much more decent lifespan than twenty: say, 72 (according to a study I found summarized by <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/life-expectancy-hunter-gatherer/#axzz21zEyUZZp\" rel=\"nofollow\">this guy again</a>). That&#39;s better than the average world lifespan, and can probably be improved on further by the addition of sanitation practices, which are something that didn&#39;t catch on until people figured out germs weren&#39;t evil spirits. And during their respectably long lives, hunter-gatherers have almost none of the things I mentioned as diseases of civilization. <br /><br />I do plan on reading about medicinal herbs. Actually, just yesterday I heard about a book I intend to read: <i>The Forgotten Language of Plants</i>. Seems interesting. Though it actually doesn&#39;t go without saying. The guy who wrote my favorite wild edibles identification books, Sam Thayer, says something along the lines of, &quot;I take medicine maybe once every two years. I eat food every day.&quot; He was explaining why he only covers food uses of the plants in the book. Seemed pretty reasonable to me."
