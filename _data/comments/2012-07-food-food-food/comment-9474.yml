text: "I commend you for thinking through these things.  If it makes you feel better (later after your travels) I hope you do it and stay healthier.  Unprocessed is supposed to be much better for you.  <br /><br />One thing, though-- it seems to me that in cave man days it would have been rare to have anyone live past 40, with the normal life span probably in the 20s or less even.  Not likely that they&#39;d have had to worry about &quot;old age&quot; problems at all.  Just keeping from starving or being killed by wild animals.<br /><br />As long as you are interested, why don&#39;t you research herbs and natural medicines used by early man, too.  Go for the whole show.  Or maybe that goes without saying on the paleo diet.  Grandma"
