text: "Yeah, it&#39;s frustrating to realize that no one really knows the ultimate answer. I think maybe better (perhaps more modern) overall advice than &quot;Eat a variety of foods&quot; would be &quot;Eat unprocessed foods.&quot;  <br /><br />I heard about a book called <i>The Vegetarian Myth</i>. It&#39;s by a woman (named Lierre Keith) who was vegan for 20 years and then realized that her health had been ruined because of it. I can&#39;t remember how it manifested but I think it was to do with her spine. Then she also did an investigation into cultivation of the grains and vegetables she&#39;d been relying on, and discovered that tons of animals get killed during the process of plowing, and also of course the conversion of that land from prairie to farm destroyed tremendous amounts of habitat. So now she&#39;s eating meat."
