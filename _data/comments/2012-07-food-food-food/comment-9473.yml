text: "It&#39;s balance.  Michael Phelps the  olympic swimmer eats 6000 to 8000 calories a day.  Heavyweight weight lifters eat 10,000 to 14,000 calories a day.  The difference is that they need that many calories for their lifestyle.  I saw an interview of a heavyweight lifter regarding his breakfast .  He normally ate 2 dozen eggs, 2 loafs of toast, 2 pounds of bacon, a box of cereal and a half gallon of milk.  He need that many calories.  You have an active lifestyle, walking running climbing mountains, etc.  I would recommend &quot; listen to the Hippo in the mud pond&quot;,,  &quot;If it feels good, do it.  Grandpa"
