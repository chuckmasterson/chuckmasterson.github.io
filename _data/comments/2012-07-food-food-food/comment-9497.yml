text: "Just be careful.  All these diet things tend to be fads that come and go as new information comes out.  It is all so intricate that nobody really knows,yet, what&#39;s the absolute right thing to do.  <br /><br />The dieticians I used to work with said their best advice was to &#39;eat a variety of foods.&#39;<br /><br />A friend of mine, when young and trying hard to do what was really healthful, became a vegetarian.  I don&#39;t know if she didn&#39;t do it right, or what exactly happened with her, but she ended up with Epstein-Barr, and it took her a long time to recover -- the irony being that she was trying to be healthy.
