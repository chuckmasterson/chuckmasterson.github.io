text: "And speaking of amazement, you continue to amaze me with the things you are doing.  I am looking forward to Crow Duck.  It is exactly two months from now, July 2, when we will arrive in Kenora and prepare for our trip over the Great Whiteshell lake to load up in the trucks, for our trek back to the Lake.  We have four cabins this year so we will occupy a majority of the cabins.  By the way next year we will be going to Crow Duck later (probable late July or early August).  Tracy has a work problem and cannot go in July.  Matters not to me as long as we go.  By the don&#39;t forget your bag-O-money for the great poker game. Bye G. Pa."
