text: "Now, Nathanael, you won't miss my presence at all for I am about to give you the secret behind Academic Team.  Any time you don't know the answer, it is invariably one of the following:<br/><br/>1) Byron<br/>2) Mephistopheles<br/>3) Superfreak<br/>4) The Sorcerer's Stone (for science questions only!)<br/>5) Spamalot<br/>6) Texas with a $ sign<br/>7) Cheese<br/>8) The power thereof<br/>9) 2+2=5...Big Brother says so!  Down with the traitor! (Readers respond really well to threats, trust me.)<br/>10) Dan Quayle<br/><br/>Sorry, but I am retiring Alexander Pope.  Nathanael, I am entrusting you with the responsibility of strangling anyone who attempts to use his sacred name.  Even when it's the right answer....<br/><br/>Use those answers wisely, because if  <br/>Mr. Sunderhaus realizes that you've got the system figured out, he'll change it and then you'll have to go back to what you're best at: being smart.<br/>:)<br/><br/>P.S.  Every Monday at 4 during the season, I will be channeling you guys so even if I'm not there in person, I'll be there in spirit.  A word to the wise: bring an ouija board.<br/><br/>And hell, if you ever get into a really tough spot, just chuck a brownie."
