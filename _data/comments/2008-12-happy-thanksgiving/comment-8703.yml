You should have gone to Miami, I could have gotten you a job at the ice rink driving the Zamboni and then since you would be experienced at driving on ice, you wouldn't have had any problem with the roads. Well, maybe not.<br/><br/>Oh, and you forgot to mention that after a tough battle in that game of war, I was victorious.  Interesting how you left out that little fact.  Additionally, you conveniently forgot to mention that I was the pool tournament champion too.  I’d say you’ll make a good reporter some day.  Just kidding!"
