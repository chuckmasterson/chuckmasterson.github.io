text: "Wow, that sounds pretty entertaining, Aunt Ellen. A lot of people talked about the road conditions after they got back. I heard one person say they just barely stayed on the road after hitting a patch of black ice, and then they looked to the side and there were two cars in the ditch on one side and another on the other side. Maybe that's the spot where you guys skidded off... sounded pretty lethal."
