text: "We are so glad that you are back at Grinnell safe and sound.  We hope you are really learning to drive safely in Iowa winter weather.  It's not fun.  So please be careful and always take it slow when in doubt.  <br/><br/>We are also glad you enjoy eating here.  Do you have a special Christmas meal request?  <br/><br/>Also, don't forget that deadline for Junior Year Abroad.  I'll be interested in hearing where you finally choose to go.  I could suggest Finland if it's available.  I like to think of it as a European Canada.  They're a lot alike.  Bet you'd get some good cold weather there, even with the jet stream.  Grandma"
