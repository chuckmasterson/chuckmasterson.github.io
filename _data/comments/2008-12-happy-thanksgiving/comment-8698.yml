text: "It sounds like you almost skidded off the road at exactly the spot Uncle Chuck really did skid off the road in December 2000.  That was a scary event too.  We went in the ditch, but there was so much snow it softened the blow as we slowed, out of control, and ended up practically 180ยบ from our original direction.  We weren't hurt, and neither was the car, thank goodness.  I-80 is very slippery in that area.<br/><br/>We're glad you learned from your experience.<br/><br/>Aunt E."
