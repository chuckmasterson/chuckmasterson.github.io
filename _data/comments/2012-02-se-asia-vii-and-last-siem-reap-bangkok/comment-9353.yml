text: "Glad you both liked it. As for making money off of this, well, my hit counter is at maybe a couple dozen people a day, not nearly enough to make money from blogging, as far as I know at least. (I met a guy at the orientation who makes money from his blog, and it sounded like it was stressful - he always had to be uploading new stuff to make sure he didn&#39;t lose readership, and he had to track his page rank on Alexa, and he had to network with other bloggers all the time - it sounded like a job unto itself even besides the writing.) And I&#39;m not aware of any established outlets accepting submissions of novella-length scatterbrained travelogs like this one... but if you have ideas, I&#39;d investigate them. I&#39;ll give thought to this stuff when I&#39;m writing about Europe. (But I&#39;ve been thinking about avoiding having to write up something this long again by just telling people all the stories face-to-face when I get back. This took a while!)"
