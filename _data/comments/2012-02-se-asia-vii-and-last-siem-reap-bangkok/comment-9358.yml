text: "We are back from a cruise in the southern Caribbean.  Not bad to do in February.  Want to tell you that I finally got rid of the wine/beer you sent me for Christmas.  I just couldn&#39;t drink it.  It reminded me of some rice wine we had in China that was not to my taste, either.  Guess I just love the grape kind too much.  Ha.  Anyway, I am enthralled with your last blog.  You are one extraordinary man.  You have made me want to visit southeast Asia for sure, but not in the way you have done it.  It would kill me, so I&#39;ll just be one of those horrible tourists you see at all the spots.  Keep it up.<br /><br />Grandma"
