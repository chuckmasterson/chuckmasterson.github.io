Sending the right articles to the right people. <br /><br />It seems like very few travel writers support themselves entirely on their writing â€” and those that can support themselves rarely get rich in the process. Not like that&#39;s why we write or why we travel. <br /><br />Meh. Tangent. Another great post dude.<br /><br />Sean"
