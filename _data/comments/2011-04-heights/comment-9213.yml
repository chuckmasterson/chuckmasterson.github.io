text: "I heard about Dan&#39;s escapade. He left a blog comment about it the first time I mentioned climbing buildings. I told him that all the buildings I climb are shorter and less attention-getting than a water tower, and thus I expect people to care a bit less. But I certainly keep the consequences in mind."
