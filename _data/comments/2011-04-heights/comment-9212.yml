text: "You could ask Dan how his adventures in climbing things went.  It&#39;s not a happy ending.  I hope your climbing adventures will soon be over, since you now seem overwhelmed with adult responsibilities.<br />One day at a time, never give up, etc. etc.  I know you will get through it all, just in time to get involved in something else up to your ears.  That&#39;s life.<br /><br />But you have all those wonderful life adventures ahead of you.  Lucky you.  See you in May.  Grandma"
