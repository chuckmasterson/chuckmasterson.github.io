text: "Oh wow, I just realized I&#39;ve been walking around with that in my wallet for a long time, and just haven&#39;t gone to a bank. Thanks for the reminder. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll need to spend it on things like food. Last night, for example, I went out and found about a dozen delicious sandwiches and twenty cups of yogurt. Also, I did some early foraging with a friend and we found lots of wild carrots. But if a need should ever arise, I&#39;ll be able to take care of it."
