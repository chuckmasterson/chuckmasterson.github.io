text: "Glad you got the cookies.  Enjoy!  Loved your description of the kids you teach.  It sounds so much like what I was always trying to do, and not succeeding all the time.  Kids don&#39;t want to speak the language spontaneously.  They want to goof off.  And it&#39;s too bad they are so much into conformity, especially when they&#39;re young kids who could be creative.  But I&#39;m glad you like them and are plugging away as hard as you can.  But it just underscores what I always said.  You really can&#39;t get fluent by classroom methods, you have to go live in the culture and be forced to speak the language.  And then it happens."
