text: "I&#39;ll be in Wyoming for a little over a week between the end of school (May 21) and when I leave for NYC (May 29? 30?). I accept your offer of ginger snaps. After that I&#39;ll be in New York until about August 6 or 7, and then I&#39;ll be in Wyoming briefly before going off to do GORP one last time. And then I&#39;ll come back again to plan out my Big Semester, wrangle up my friends, buy supplies for it, and so on. And from there I&#39;ll be off."
