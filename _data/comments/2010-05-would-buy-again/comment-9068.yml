text: "Is this the 21st Century American young man&#39;s equivalent to the &quot;seeing the continent and sowing some wild oats right after university&quot; of the upper class British gentlemen in the 19th?   Of course, after they came home they then took up their lifelong responsibility of guarding the family fortune.  Will you come out of this actually ready to work for a living?????<br />In any case, I hope you find your characters, your self, and your mission for the rest of your life.  I know it will not be a dull one.  Grandma"
