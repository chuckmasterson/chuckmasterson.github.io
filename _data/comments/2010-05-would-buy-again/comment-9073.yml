text: "I plan to use the climbing strategy sparingly, if at all. But also there are differences. For example: they frown on it a little bit more when people climb water towers than when they climb a 7-Eleven. And also I would be in a much better position to exercise stealth... you pretty much climbed the most prominent thing in town, so it&#39;s not too surprising that you&#39;re of the sort of climber that gets caught. I&#39;d plan to get up in the night after making sure no one&#39;s looking, and probably by the back; and then get down in the early morning, either before the sun has risen or before people start walking around a lot. But I&#39;ll definitely take your experience into account; I hadn&#39;t really deeply considered the legal consequences, and so now I&#39;m definitely forewarned.<br /><br />Somehow, though, it&#39;s possible to do batshit nuts climbing and still remain at large, because this guy does it: http://www.nopromiseofsafety.com/"
