text: "Good luck climbing in Manhattan! I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have much success. Abandoned buildings may be a better choice. Just don&#39;t sleep next to the empty spray paint cans. A couple of my friends killed the climbing urge by bagging the Darrtown tower at 1003 ft. Yes they are still alive. I don&#39;t recommend this however.<br /><br />I suggest rock climbing.<br /><br />Dave"
