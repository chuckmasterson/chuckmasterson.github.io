text: "Two things:<br /><br />first: <br />I noticed a couple days ago that my bottle of soy sauce in the cabinet says on the back label &quot;contains: soy&quot;. No kidding?<br /><br />second:<br />I have some experience with climbing things in college. My apparatus of choice was the late fabled Oxford water tower.  I found out shortly after making it nearly to the top that the police frown on people climbing at 3am in the morning. Needless to say, they hooked me and booked me. It&#39;s called &quot;criminal trespassing&quot; and in my case it carried a $100 fine, 55 hours community service, 30 days in jail, 30 days suspended and 2 years good behavior.  After deliberating this for a long time (exactly .00000001 seconds) following the delivery of my sentence, I realized it wasn&#39;t worth it. <br /><br />I tell you this story because climbing buildings that you don&#39;t own or have permission will always be considered criminal trespassing, or worse, they may think you are trying to break in.<br /><br />So I have to say that speaking from experience, DON&quot;T DO IT YOU FREAKIN MORON!!!  You&#39;re no longer an innocent kid, you&#39;re an adult and consequences come from your actions."
