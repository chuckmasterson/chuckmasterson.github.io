text: "I think it&#39;s considerably more constrained than 21st-century young American men, as in just me and a few other weirdos around the country. As far as I can tel, sowing wild oats has gone out of style, and I think it&#39;s a shame because now instead of fields of wild oats we have grad-school students who don&#39;t know why they&#39;re in grad school, or are just doing it because it&#39;s the default next thing to do. <br /><br />I do plan to make money someday, if for no other reason then so I can get rid of my damn student loans."
