  Changes? Well, I'm going to learn to hunt this winter, I'm going to be
  spending a lot more time outside in the coming growing season than I have in
  this one, and I'll probably move in or before spring. Those may not be the
  changes you're hoping to find out about, but they're the only ones I can
  predict with at least middling confidence. I like life to be somewhat
  unpredictable.
