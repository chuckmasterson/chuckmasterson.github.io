  Your writing as usual is superb.  I'm so glad to be one of the "parents" you
  happen to know, but I refuse to give you any advice, of course.  Regardless of
  how you spend your life, one of the guarantees is that you will never stop
  learning.  P.S.  The next time you are in Broomfield, stop and see your OTHER
  cousin, who lives only about 10 minutes away.  He and his wife would gladly
  welcome you to their home.  P.S.  The Dear Ella and Tom books are disappearing
  rapidly!
