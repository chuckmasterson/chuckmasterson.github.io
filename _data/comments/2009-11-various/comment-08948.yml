text: "I hope you don&#39;t seriously have to graduate a semester early.  Seems it ought to be able to be worked out another way.  You deserve your four full years, with many, many years afterwards to think about making your living.  Hoping for the best.  Your parents are working things out, and I&#39;m going down today to help your mom clean up the house a bit.  Life is moving forward for them, too.  Grandma"
