text: "Grinnell has a peculiar relationship with smartness, which I&#39;ve been thinking about lately. Basically, Grinnellians are good and eggheaded on most of the weekdays, or whenever they have to be. But on the weekends, almost the entire campus voluntarily regresses back to about nine years old. To do this they drink enormous amounts of terrible booze, which is nothing new, except that there&#39;s such a distinct split between drunk and sober. When there&#39;s time, Grinnellians basically flip a switch and skip straight past buzzed, tipsy, and equilibrium-impaired, into stone hard drunk. In this state—and here&#39;s the regressive part—they listen to terrible music, stuff that I thought even the mainstream was close to hating. Lady Gaga isn&#39;t the extent of it. People here listen to Miley Cyrus (&quot;Party in the USA&quot; is near the top of the Grinnell charts, apparently) and her fellow chart-topping crap music; rap without brains; and, I&#39;m sure, other stuff that I&#39;ve missed. And while drunk they also watch Disney movies and smash stuff and just generally act like children. It makes me wonder whether a lot of Grinnellians had such hard-driven childhoods that they use all their free time trying to recoup the time they lost then. Or maybe they just get sick of being so smart all the damn time. Or maybe it&#39;s a mob mentality thing, and everyone gets way drunker than they normally would because everyone else is getting so drunk. I get confused by this aspect of Grinnell, but I&#39;ve been able to deal with it by just avoiding the loud, smelly, vomiting crowds that appear every weekend. It&#39;s kind of weird, but I guess I&#39;m okay with it."
