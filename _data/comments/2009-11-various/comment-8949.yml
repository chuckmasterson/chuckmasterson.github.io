text: "Sounds like you have things and options under control.  Your idea of an internship is excellent.  You might think about looking into grad schools.  Grad assistantships pay tuition, fees and a stipend.  You may end up teaching freshman english - not a bad job actually.   It&#39;s nice to have someone pay you to go to school,   Hang in there.
