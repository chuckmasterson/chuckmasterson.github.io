text: "Costa Rica is one of the most promising of the Central American countries.  They don&#39;t abide homelessness there, providing minimal structures, at least, for all citizens.  They are trying very hard to encourage small business development, many for women who are trying to build financial skills.  You would be amazed at the diversity of the climate and wildlife.  I sure hope you can go.<br /><br />And we also hope you&#39;re on track for the internship for next summer.  <br /><br />Aunt E."
