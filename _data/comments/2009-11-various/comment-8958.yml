text: "Copy-pasted from Facebook in case you don&#39;t see that first:<br /><br />It&#39;s with a seminar on sustainability in Costa Rica, and it features a trip to Costa Rica over spring break. I&#39;m actually as excited for the seminar as I am for the trip, because I think they&#39;ll both be a blast. But &quot;goin&#39; to Costa Rica!&quot; seemed like it&#39;d have more impact than &quot;takin&#39; a seminar on Costa Rica!&quot; Mom asked in Spanish if I&#39;ll be working on a farm there. In all probability, yes, but not with the seminar - that&#39;ll be next spring, I believe, in my spare semester that I&#39;ll get from graduating early."
