text: "I say go a semester early. The college experience that most wax poetic about died and went to hell in about 1968. The alcohol vomit crowd is on every campus. My roomate freshman year made a habit of getting up in a drunken stupor, and peeing in the corner.<br /><br />In other words, you&#39;ll have much more fun in Costa Rica, or anywhere else for that matter. Once you are close enough to taste graduation, the &quot;college experience&quot; has long since &quot;jumped the shark&quot;.<br /><br />I second the grad school thing. You&#39;ll find that at the larger Universities, the ones with lots of grad programs, have a much more segregated campus life. The grad students manage to find lots of space and are successful at keeping the &quot;look mom! I&#39;m in college now! Barf...&quot; crowd away from them.<br /><br />Dave"
