text: "But, er, I want to. Because I like college, but I also think it&#39;d be super awesome to gain an extra semester, free of college work and college tuition, and be able to go to Costa Rica and work on an organic farm. It&#39;s not putting me off—I&#39;m actually glad that we started talking about money, because it caused me to look up this early-graduation thing, which I now think is a good idea for me reagardless of whether we&#39;re millionaires or living in cardboard boxes.<br /><i>—Cardboard? Boy, that&#39;s purty fancy! When I was a boy all I had was paper bags! I had to paper them up on a frame of sticks that I lashed together with twine!<br />—You had paper bags? I would have given my life&#39;s savings for a paper bag! All I had was origami paper. Every time a wind come by, I had to move three or four mailboxes down the street!<br />—Huh! You boys obviously never had to live in a house made of bubbles!</i>"
