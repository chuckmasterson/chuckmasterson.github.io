text: "Taunting and haunting images.  Grandma is right, I need to get on the same page.  I have wanted especially to see the temples of Angkor Wat.   And the trees, which remind  me of some in Costa Rica.  Maybe it is a tropics thing.  I will need to look at these pictures at least one more time before I can really comment on them.  In the words of Grandma---  WOW!.   G.Pa."
