text: "All I can say is WOW.  You have captured the essence of the area.  I would have liked to see pictures of the place in Laos where the rafting/whiskey was, though.  I still can&#39;t imagine that place.  Anyway, seeing these things through your eyes has made me want to see them on my own trip there--now if I can just get Grandpa on the same page.  Ha.  BTW, we are going to be in Spain/Portugal in October.  If you are going to be bumming around in Europe then, we could get together.  We&#39;d be able to spend some time in Madrid, for sure.
