text: "Here&#39;s the schedule.  Days 2 - 4 Madrid.  Days 5 - 6 Cordoba  Days 7 - 9 Torremolinas  Days 10 - 11 Seville Days 12 - 14 Lisbon.  You could visit us anytime during that time, but we&#39;d have more free time at the beginning in Madrid.  If you can get to any of those places, we&#39;ll be happy.  Trains in Europe are easy.  You can manage it with no problem from Germany, or go back that way when you&#39;re done with Spain.  We&#39;ll be so excited to have time with you however it can be worked out.  Grandma"
