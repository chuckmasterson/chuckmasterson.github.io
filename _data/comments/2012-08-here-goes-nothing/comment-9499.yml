Alternatively, though, you can create a Scribd account, which is drop-dead easy, and only requires you to enter your email address. Then you can download it and print it right out. Glad you liked it so much. I&#39;ve never really written anything with a lot of dialog in it before, so I was nervous about how that would turn out, but from what people are saying, it sounds like I got it.<br /><br />I looked at Time&#39;s website, but it only gave me a teaser paragraph and told me to subscribe to read the rest. Maybe I&#39;ll find a copy in some library in Europe or something. But I&#39;ve heard about this mining issue, and I&#39;m going to keep an ear out for whether anyone says something interesting about it. Chances are I won&#39;t be getting anywhere close to the mine itself."
