text: "I have only read it over once so can&#39;t critique yet, but can say I think it&#39;s up to the standard of any story I&#39;ve ever read.  You&#39;re my kind of writer.  What I love most is that it is absolute heartfelt truths.  Your dialogue is totally realistic.  Don&#39;t change that.  If I can figure out how to download and print, I can mull it over more, and might be able to make some more specific comments.  Can you tell me how to get a hold-in-my-hand copy?  I&#39;m too old-fashioned to do my best reading on a screen.  (I was afraid to try downloading to Facebook, I don&#39;t know where it might show up again that you wouldn&#39;t appreciate.) <br />Irene"
