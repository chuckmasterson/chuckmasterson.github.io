text: "Thanks, Grandma! I&#39;m not sure why I waited to say I&#39;m glad you liked it. I think I was waiting for anyone else to comment as well, or something, but that doesn&#39;t really make much sense. Anyhow, it&#39;s good to hear it turned out okay. That&#39;s actually not my first story, it&#39;s more like my second completed one, and the stuff I wrote for the frog story added up to longer than this story&#39;s total length (but I figured at some point that with the frogs it wasn&#39;t working and I needed to start all over againâ€”someday that story will appear). I&#39;m thinking about ideas for new stories too, so it shouldn&#39;t be the last one in any case."
