text: "I took Phoenix out to Hueston Woods today, and we walked the trail.  Just thought you'd like to know that the creek is completely dried up-- there's only a little muddy stuff at that place where the tree fell over the deepest water and you used to climb on the tree.  I'm so sorry to see such a drought that not even that \"swimmin' hole\" survived.  Phoenix enjoyed the walk anyway, but he couldn't even get a drink from the creek!  Enjoy the wetter weather in Grinnell.  It couldn't be much worse here.  Grandma"
