text: "I have what's called an aligned fracture of the fibula.  I didn't need a cast, but have a boot instead.  It looks like a huge ski boot and keeps my ankle in the right place.  I have to have it for four weeks and then another x-ray.  That's not as bad as I thought, but Phoenix will miss his walks for that long.  Grandpa takes him but not as far as I did.  Are you coming home for Thanksgiving?  Grandma"
