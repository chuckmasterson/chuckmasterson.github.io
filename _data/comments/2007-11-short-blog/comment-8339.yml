text: "Ahh. There was a girl at school last year who had a big boot like that. For the duration, she reveled in being called \"Boot\".<br/><br/>For Thanksgiving, we get Thursday and Friday off, and then of course the weekend. I've requested a ride to Cincinnati or somewhere near it, on the ride board, leaving as soon as possible. I don't know if I'll get any bites. In any case, getting to Cincinnati and then West Virginia by Thursday at dinnertime seems tenuous. If I get a ride, Friday may be possible. I may end up staying here, which would make me kinda sad. But then, I've got four weeks of winter vacation, practically a solid month, so I'll be happy. And I already know I've got a ride for that - Jordan's driving. Also, spring break is two weeks long here, did you know?"
