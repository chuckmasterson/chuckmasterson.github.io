text: "If you are getting paid then no it can't count.  My idea was that maybe you could give some free tutoring sessions until you get those hours, and call it a \"trial period.\"  If they stick with it through that then they will be more attached to you when you start making them pay.  However, if you've already got hours lined up then forget that.  Just make sure you get the Community Service form signed by Miss Hartlaub."
