text: "I don't have my 10 individual service hours, but does this count if I'm getting paid? If not, I'm also still doing that stuff in Miss Hartlaub's room once a week, and there are clearly more than 10 weeks left until May. I just have to make sure Patrice doesn't schedule any more Tuesdays. Also, I in fact already have a copy of <i>Night</i>. I figure I'll eventually read it."
