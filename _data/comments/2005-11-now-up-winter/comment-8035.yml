Slow down the cult activities to give you guys a  rest?  Why, that wouldn't be in the spirit of Mr. Canter's little network.  Has he mentioned whether you'll be sacrificing a goat, a cow, or a tuba at the rededication of the PAC?<br/><br/>Sorry to hear you guys got a II instead of a I this year.  Indigestion does that to people.<br/><br/>Mr. Volz isn't wrong.  I think I got low Bs the first two tests.  The worst one was over the Jackson presidency, where I got a whopping 76% on that particular test.  It was an uphill struggle to get an A that quarter.  That class is purposefully challenging so I wouldn't worry too much about it.<br/><br/>If I were hungry right now, I'd want a cookie.  Oh wait, I have one.<br/>:)<br/><br/>BJ<br/><br/>P.S.  If I remember correctly, you first match is this Monday.  Bonne chance!"
