text: "Hello, Nathanael<br /><br />Out of an overwhelming desire to find something better to do besides write my psychology paper, I have stumbled upon your blog.  Not bad.<br /><br />How is your campaign to preserve the Warder Nursery progressing?<br /><br />I agree, Catcher in the Rye was the worst \"classic\" I have ever read.  Holden needs an attitude adjustment, preferably via a botched lobotomy.<br /><br />If you ever decide to either create a map of Finneytown or embark on a quest to find a (good) one, let me know.  I also like maps.<br /><br />That'll do for now.<br /><br />BJ"
