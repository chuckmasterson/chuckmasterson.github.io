text: "I&#39;ve got a pretty good amount of money saved up. At least enough for the rent, if I can in fact get the apartment that I think I&#39;ve found. (The person still hasn&#39;t gotten back to me about it. I really hope it&#39;s available.) That&#39;d be cool to have you visit, although it&#39;d be expensive for you. Well, I could probably use a sleeping bag to make some room for you wherever I end up sleeping. Chances are I may be using a sleeping bag anyhowâ€”I think I&#39;ll be packing really light to get to New York on the Amtrak, so blanketry will be a bunch of bulk I could replace with a sleeping bag."
