text: "NYC isn&#39;t so bad. You get any kind of food you want at any time. Let me know exactly what you are looking for and I can send out some feelers. I have a friend who is a Manhattanite but lives in Queens now. He might have some ideas. One of my fellow  pilots has a brother who lives in the city.<br /><br />Central park is acutally quite nice and quite large. It is also one of the only places that have the original Elm trees, which I am sure you can appreciate.<br /><br />http://forestry.about.com/od/forestryphotofeatures/ss/northpark_trees_7.htm<br /><br />You&#39;ll have fun I predict! I suggest trying to live not in Manhattan and to take the Subways. It really is the only way to get around, and it is cheap to boot. It&#39;s a way of living none like any other.<br /><br />Dave"
