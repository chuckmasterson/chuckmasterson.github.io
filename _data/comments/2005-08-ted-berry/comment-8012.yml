text: "School starts back up for you on the 24th, extra early this year.  I have been gloating to my brother that not only does Brandeis start after Finneytown (the 1st), but I also finish about a month before you guys do.  Plus, I learn more. :)<br/><br/>Now that I'm done being a jerk, my last day in Cincinnati is also the 24th, and I'd like to see you, Matt, and Aaron again before I go.  So I was thinking we'd go bowling the week of the 18th.  Drop me a line if    <br/>it is a yea or a nay. <br/><br/>BJ"
