text: "The next time you have a snow delay that lasts eleven days, make sure you let me know how many days it takes for you to start complaining.<br /><br />Mexico is only one dream, and it&#39;s one I can satisfy now (or whenever Ruben finally gets his shit together). The other continents will be the ones I make into longer-term dreams. Don&#39;t try to keep me away from Mexico... no one but Ruben can do that. Speaking of which, today he went with a new tactic and instead of doing pointless stuff slowly until the day was over, he just didn&#39;t contact me. I&#39;ve graduated from being frustrated with him to fucking hating him."
