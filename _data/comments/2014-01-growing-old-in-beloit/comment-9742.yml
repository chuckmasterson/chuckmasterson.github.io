text: "His nephew is here with me and knows the guy pretty well. He says Ruben is always putting off trips until a series of tomorrows that finally, one day, come. It usually doesn&#39;t take this long, he says, but I attribute that to the addition of Alejandro. I asked last night if he thought Ruben might actually be deriving amusement from this or might not have any intention of taking me to Mexico, but he says no, it&#39;s just Ruben being Ruben, and in fact the caginess might mean we&#39;re going to leave soon, because he always seems to get the most agitated and erratic just before he leaves."
