It&#39;s all a day in the life of the debt PIIGS.<br /><br />The paintings you see on the ceiling of St. Peter are depictions of stories in the bible. This was common practice in medieval churches as most if not all of the parishioners were illiterate. Sometimes a picture is worth more than a 1000 words, especially if you don&#39;t know any.<br /><br />As a Christian , I too find the Catholics compelling and perplexing. Having read St Augustine, the original Catholic, I know he was absolutely fascinated with the letters of Paul but don&#39;t recall him ever fixating on the virgin Mary. I&#39;m not sure how or where this became such a seminal point of Catholic theology but it did.<br /><br />Dave"
