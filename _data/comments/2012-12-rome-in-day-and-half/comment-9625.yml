text: "This came about because at one point the Romans made statues of Diana, and when Christianity became dominant, people stopped buying these statues. The sculptors of these statures were losing a lot of money. It then occurred to them to make statues of Mary and substitute her for Diane in the pantheon. In fact, the church under Constantine began replacing the Roman pantheon with Christian martyrs and saints. Mom"
