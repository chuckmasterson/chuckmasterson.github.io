text: "I am so glad you are in London, warm and dry under a real roof.  it sounds as though Italy was not the wonderful place you hoped it would be, at least if you are back packing.  Someday you can go when you can afford more of the things it has to offer.  <br /><br />We are looking forward to seeing you soon.  In the meantime, please stay warm and dry.  Grandma<br /><br />Oh,  and i hope you got to enjoy some good French wine before you left France.  I&#39;ll drink to that."
