text: "You can call me Waabanang-inini, but it's a bit of a mouthful for most people. I translated it into English as \"Morrow\" (an old word for 'morning'), and there are a few people who call me that. But any name you know me by works, really.\r\n\r\nFunny enough, Thomas is taken from the Bible too. I think Christianity, in its most helpful flavors, does understand that spirit exists and can be communed with. I think that's what monks and nuns are supposed to be doing in their monasteries, though I may be wrong there. The trouble is that there are very few Christians in the U.S. who follow a Christianity as real as that. Most of them have barely even read the Bible, and a fair number follow a Jesus who is pretty much the opposite of the Jesus described there. If your friend Thomas is Christian, I bet he's the kind that wouldn't actually know Christ if He came up and washed Tom's feet."
