But how about Thomas or Tom? My friend failed to answer. As I have written to you that my name has meaning in Arabic, I believe that every name is a prayer. So with your name, I hope you can be like the prayer you asked. Oh I dont know that Christianity does not believe in spirit. Cause I believe in something unseen (not just spirits, but also heaven, hell and things human cant feel, cant see and cant touch). Reading your story is like an enlighment for me, a whole new culture."
