text: "So - watch out for the Wild Ass of the Gobi (I&#39;m serious))  they can be dangerous.  As for Crow Duck (yes it is two words) you will be pleased to know that I left a few fish in the lake so that you would have something to look forward too.  For example:  I left all the master angler Bass behind and any Northern over three or four pounds.  The perch are still there and who cares about the Walleye, you can&#39;t keep or eat them, thus I consider them a pest fish.  <br /><br />There were many Eagles and Loons this year and I saw a couple of blue Herons and a few deer.  No bear or wolves but many crows, ravens, squirrels, and chipmunks all of which were after my peanuts.<br /><br />Do you know the approximate date that you will leave Korea?  Have fun but play it safe.  Grandpa"
