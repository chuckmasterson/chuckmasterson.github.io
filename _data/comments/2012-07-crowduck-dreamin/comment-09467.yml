text: "Oh, my!  Crow Duck in your dreams?  I can tell you that the real Crow Duck was pretty special, too, although this year it was hot hot hot and dry.  We never unpacked our cold weather stuff.<br /><br />Fishing was good when we went out, but with five kids to deal with it was hard to get out that much, so we didn&#39;t bring home as much fish.  We did, however, have our usual fry ups and pigged out.<br /><br />We really, really, really missed you there!  We needed more boat drivers.  I am ready to have you back with us next year for sure!  We spent most of the hottest two days swimming to keep cool.  Hayden is turning into a fish.  He swims effortlessly in deep water and never gets tired of being there.<br /><br />The little ones liked the water, too, and Sierra Gwyneth was really happy there.  Sierra Grace preferred to get onto one of the paddle boats they&#39;ve just gotten there.<br /><br />We&#39;re really looking forward to seeing you in Lisbon, too.  But please take good care of yourself on the way there!  Grandma"
