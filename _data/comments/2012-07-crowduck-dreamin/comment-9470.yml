text: "Fair enough!  Drivers this year were David, Dan and me.  Driving two boats at a time will be interesting , especially when one is going to North Bay and the other to Gull Shit.  I knew you were good but I didn&#39;t know you were that good.  Maybe I can get you on crazy people tricks on the David Letterman show for either boat driving or finger snapping.  By the way have you ever shown your student your finger snapping expertise?  If you do, cam the students and put it on Facebook.  I want to see there faces.  Then ask them to try it. I want to see that also.  G.Pa"
