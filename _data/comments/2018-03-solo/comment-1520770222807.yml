text: "Sounds like you’re at an existential crossroad. All of this analysis paralysis reminds me of the movie Forrest Gump. “I don’t know if we each have a destiny, or if we’re all just floating around accidental-like on a breeze, but I think maybe it’s both.”\r\n\r\nOr in biblical circles, do we adopt the doctrine of free will, or predestination? Both are supported by scripture, and some claim both are possible and at work at the same time.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to find something, one thing you’re passionate about and chase it, engage it fully, and further clarity will come later. And if you can’t find your passion, just keep running like Forrest Gump(or bike). Exercise does as much for your mental acuity as it does for your physical fitness. I ran 200 miles last month and have never felt, or thought better.\r\n\r\nDave"
