text: "Jin-won and I talked about the rocket launch. He says basically South Koreans aren&#39;t afraid of the North. There&#39;s not really a lot the North can do without bringing down the wrath of the entire world on them. Just launching a rocket, even one that blew up a minute away from the launchpad, has caused them to lose a lot of their food aid. If they dropped a bomb, it would be their endgame as a country. Jin-won expects the standoff to go on for a long time, possibly decades. But eventually the Koreas will be reunited. Right now young Koreans think it&#39;d me too costly, but despite the cost, if push comes to shove, most all South Koreans will support reunification with a collapsing North Korea to make sure China doesn&#39;t snap it up."
