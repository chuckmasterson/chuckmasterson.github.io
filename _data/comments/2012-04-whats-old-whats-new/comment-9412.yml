And it&#39;s really wonderful that you&#39;ve made a friend to learn Korean with.  That&#39;s the best of all.  You are right to worry about losing the language after you leave, but then you&#39;ll be squeezing more Russian into your head, so that will be good.  Anyway, with your great language skills, I&#39;d bet your Korean will stay there, even if it gets shoved to the back of your brain cells, so to speak.<br /><br />Any talk  there about N. Korea and the failed launch?  Were they ridiculed, ignored, or what?  And is the feeling that things are better, worse, or the same under the new leader?  We don&#39;t get much news from there unless it&#39;s drastic.  Grandma"
