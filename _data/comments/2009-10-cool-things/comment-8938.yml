text: "Wow, Aunt Ellen, that&#39;s pretty awesome. I&#39;ll have to mention that to everyone nearby whenever the subject of Herbie Hancock comes up. Do you do that? <br />-I took a guess on this one—I guess I got the decade wrong. But it doesn&#39;t sound like crap. It&#39;s got better sound quality than all our modern speakers, although that&#39;s mainly because they&#39;re small. This really was a high-end stereo system. I&#39;ll take a picture sometime.<br />-The Japanese sentence was longer in pixels than the English one because I don&#39;t know the kanji for a lot of it yet. However, it&#39;s also nigh unreadable at this size, so I&#39;d probably have to make the type a couple sizes bigger for real legibility, and then English would win out again. Oh well. I won&#39;t defend Japan&#39;s writing system, which is hilariously inefficient and difficult and doesn&#39;t befit a country of Japan&#39;s level of technical advancement.<br />-The pizzas were in fact vegetarian. Thes was partly because there are a lot of vegetarians here, and partly because I didn&#39;t have any meat. <br />-As for debt: I figure if I can lighten my load, why not? The early-graduating plan that I mentioned up there still involves me being in college for my full four years—it&#39;s just that the last semester I would be taking a really light load, and living off campus. Like I said, though, I still haven&#39;t even worked through the logistics to see if I can even possibly do it. Graduating one semester early would save me 15 grand, which is a pretty significant amount of money, and even if I spend a bunch of what I saved housing myself and paying for maybe an extra class or two (you can only take one at the alumni rate, and after that they cost some $100 apiece), I&#39;ll still be up about enough to buy something keen like a world vacation or a keen used car, or more likely just pay off my student loans sooner. Just because debt is a way of life in developed countries doesn&#39;t mean I agree with it. Look at my agreement rate with the rest of the ways of life in developed countries."
