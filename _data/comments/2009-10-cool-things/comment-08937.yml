(except that they were anything but &quot;hi-fi!&quot;)<br /><br />Third, your sentence in Japanese was greater in length than the English version, that&#39;s an inefficient use of pixels, FINALLY the Americans are more efficient than them damned Japs!<br /><br />Fourth, don&#39;t worry about the debt.  Tracy and I are still paying on hers.  Yes, we could have paid them off long ago, but the interest rate is low enough that it makes sense not to pay them off too quickly. Debt is a way of life in all developed countries. It&#39;s just a matter of making smart decisions when taking on debt load.  Often times, taking on debt can be a very wise decision. Student loans is just one of those situations. We can discuss debt at length face to face over the holiday&#39;s if you want."
