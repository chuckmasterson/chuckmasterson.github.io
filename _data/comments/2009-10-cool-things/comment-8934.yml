text: "I finished my four years a semester early--graduated, got married and started teaching school midyear.  I was barely 21.  If I had it to do again I&#39;d stay the last semester and enjoy the relatively easy life of a college student longer.  But I was in such a hurry to grow up.  I hope you stay and enjoy your full four years.  You deserve to have it.  Grandma"
