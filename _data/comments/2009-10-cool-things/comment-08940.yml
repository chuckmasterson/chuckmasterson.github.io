text: "True, the government, mostly republicans (hehe) spent America into debt.  YOU don&#39;t have to take responsibility for it, nor do YOU have to pay for it. Everyone in America has the choice to pay taxes in America or not not pay at all. If the going gets to tough here, just move out of the country and leave the debt behind. Seriously.  Your true survival training may actually be your foreign language skills, not how to live on grubs and tree bark."
