text: "The gevernment already spent you into massive debt, your share is well into the hundreds of thousands, which I don&#39;t agree with.<br /><br />Debt will be a good thing when inflation hits. Your 15k college debt will be small taters. Default or massive inflation. Just think Germany in the 30&#39;s. The dollar could be the next peso!<br /><br />Once you are at the masters level, your ticket will most likely be paid anyway.<br /><br />Dave"
