text: "Regarding your trivia comment, here&#39;s a piece to add to it:  I sat next to Herbie Hancock in Grant O. Gale&#39;s freshman physics class!  (I was a sophomore, Herbie was a freshman.)  He was serious about majoring in physics at the time.  But we all knew he excelled on the piano and would become a pro.  It was a much better choice for him in the end!<br /><br />Aunt E."
