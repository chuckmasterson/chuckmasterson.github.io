text: "I suppose &quot;cookware&quot; is pretty indistinct. I&#39;ll have to make a list of cookware I&#39;ll want...<br /><br />Not sure if I&#39;ll be back before I leave; everything is indefinite thanks to Rub√©n. I called him today to ask if he was in the US yet, but there was no answer, which I suspect means he isn&#39;t. If he hasn&#39;t called to let me know his schedule by about the 15th, I&#39;ll just leave on my own. Can&#39;t hang around here forever; there&#39;s only so much time for exploring Latin America between now and my birthday (which is when I plan to be back)."
