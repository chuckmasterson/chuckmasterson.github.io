text: "Irene is right.  Someone&#39;s labor had to make that empty couch available in the first place, and someone&#39;s labor had to make the cars you hitch rides in available to be driven at all.  And some incompetent workperson&#39;s ineptness at managing food made it possible for good food to be tossed rather than donated or sold at a sale price or anything else that would have used it properly.  So working for money is not a bad thing at all, but necessary for all of us, save people like Hayden.  Anyway, I&#39;m glad you are doing well in Seattle and I hope you visit Steve and Cindy in Portland, too.  Grandma"
