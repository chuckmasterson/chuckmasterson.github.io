  well in my perspective, what you are doing now is so good and impresive. We do
  need really to choose which the modern life provimede our life. My goal
  someday is also having my own farm. Here in our country, farming is being a
  new trend. Like Korean, we are a communal society. Community based farming,
  home industry or even tourism is one of goverment's project. One tourism i
  have been visited before is organized by community based tourism organization.
  The leader is an ex immigrant from Korea. You can make it as a trend too tho.
  I am lucky to have you and misty (actually wanna communicate with her too^^)as
  friends from other side of world. So inspiring~ keep going !
