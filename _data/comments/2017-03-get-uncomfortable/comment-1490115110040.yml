text: "It's too bad my grandmother didn't leave a diary behind.  You are describing her life.  But what you are leaving out is that as you age, you will need things that our rotten, spoiled, culture now provides, and that you have announced you will do without--modern dentistry, which pretty much guarantees that you'll need to learn how to gum down your food someday in your later years.  You won't go to a doctor or receive any care if you fall and break a bone.  You can set it using a tree branch or something.  You will have nothing for pain, and by the time you are as old as I am, if you should live that long, you will have experienced much pain.  Getting old is not for sissies.\r\n\r\nMother Nature did not protect my poor grandmother, who lost her teeth in her 30s from lack of care.  She had 12 kids because she didn't know about something called birth control.  She was careworn.  She was old at fifty.  She welcomed the modern things that came to her later, after she had lost everything she had tried to accumulate in her life.  She would have said Good luck, Nathanael, but be prepared to repeat my life.  The good and the bad.  You can scratch some food out of bad soil, you can watch animals suffer because of lack of veterinary care, you can be cold, sick, and half starving and watch the same for your kids.  But I suppose you can smile to yourself about your lack of gasoline in your lives, and city cares, and be happy if you are willing to take all that bad with the good. \r\n\r\nI wish you well.  You may do it.  If anyone can do it, it will be you.  But do not think that you will have the life you could have had, and the world will truly be poorer because of that.  Grandma"
