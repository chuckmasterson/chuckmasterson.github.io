I just assumed that since you were so anti energy that you'd not go into medical facilities that run with electricity, etc.  And you would do without factory made things, such as pills.  I guess it would be a bit extreme, and I guess you can use some modern things, even if you are contributing then to some global warming.  My misunderstanding.  You aren't quite as extreme as I had thought.  And I certainly didn't expect you to ignore birth control--no way!  You and Misty have knowledge that my poor grandmother didn't have.  I was just pointing out that my grandmother had more on her plate than she could handle.  But it's a good thing she had at least six kids, since my mother was number 6, and without her neither of us would have ever existed.\r\n\r\nAnyway, when we go to Crow Duck this summer you two can explain more about what you're doing--I still can't separate it from the hardscrabble life I always heard about from my mother and grandmother.  Grandma"
