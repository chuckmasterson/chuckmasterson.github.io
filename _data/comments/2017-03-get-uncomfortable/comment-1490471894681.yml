  I'm really curious about farming and Indonesia---I've just been (finally)
  writing another letter to you, and before I even read your comment here, I
  wrote a bunch of questions about farming and other stuff in the letter. It's
  interesting, my impression of Indonesia was that it's a very urban country, so
  I didn't know how much farming actually happened there. Sounds like there's a
  pretty developed farming culture, if tourists come just to see it, huh?
