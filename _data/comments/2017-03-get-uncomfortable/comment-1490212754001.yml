text: "Where did I say I was going to refuse anything to do with modern dentistry? Where did I say that I would set my own broken bones? Where did I say that I was going to refuse to use birth control and  make Misty bear me twelve children?\r\n\r\nI don't intend to repeat the past exactly as it was! That would be impossible anyway. But more to the point, I recognize that some of what our culture has achieved *is* useful for achieving a good life. Yes, our culture has screwed up royally on several fronts. But while it lasted, it's also created the germ theory of disease, the recipe for decent anaesthetics, Daniel Pinkwater books, and other things that make life better. Discovering some of these things  but **keeping the knowledge of them alive doesn't need to.**\r\n\r\nIn fact keeping useful knowledge alive---no matter how it was gained, as long as it can be used in a just way---is one of the most useful things we can do at this point in history. I tried to say that.\r\n\r\nI can see why you're concerned. You saw what your grandmother went through, and you've heard of other accounts like it, so you figure it's the usual experience for people living off the land.\r\n\r\nBut living off the land doesn't require living in the Badlands, having twelve kids, and never seeing a doctor. Those are things we've learned to avoid. I don't intend to repeat those parts of the past.\r\n\r\nThe future will not be like the past. It will be similar in some ways, but there will be very important differences because of the ground we've trodden since then."
