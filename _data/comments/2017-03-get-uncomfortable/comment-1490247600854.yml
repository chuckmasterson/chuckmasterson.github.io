text: "It's true I'd prefer to avoid those places when I can, and go to places that are less energy-intensive. I believe there are probably some pretty modestly run clinics around, though I don't get sick often enough at this age to really know where to find them. But if it's a choice between a big fluorescent-lit hospital and, you know, dying, I'll go to the hospital. \r\n\r\nHospitals, energy-intensive as they are, are still a way for us to preserve our current knowledge of treating illness into a future where, hopefully, we can use the same knowledge even with less energy available to us. I'm for them changing drastically, but I'm also for them continuing to exist and stop unnecessary deaths while we wait for that to happen."
