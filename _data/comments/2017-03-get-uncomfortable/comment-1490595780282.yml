  ahahaa.. Indonesia is not all urban invaded land. Metropolitan cities such as
  jakarta and Batam might look like american LA or New York. But in the
  sub-urban or outside java island, we have farming lands. Some of them are
  community based farming land. I have one friend whom family has own farming.
  The farm not only plants dragon fruit and sell the raw fruits to the market
  but also make a farming program such us cooking class and sell the cake or
  biscuits too by social media. Today i just randomly searched about farming in
  Indonesia. i found out one farming with english program. I believe you are
  interested on it [link says
