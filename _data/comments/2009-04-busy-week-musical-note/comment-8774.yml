text: "Actually, I really like U2, and it's not that I don't like Bono, I'm just not such a fan of people using their popularity in one realm to push an agenda in another.  That said, Bono has done a lot of good things in the world, but I don't always agree with his methods and tactics in achieving those accomplishments. But hey, nobody is perfect!"
