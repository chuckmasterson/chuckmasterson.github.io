text: "With all due respect, Bono's quote could easily be construed as describing every person in the universe. You either believe in god and therefor are considered to be running toward him, or you don't believe in god and therefore you are obviously running from him. There you have it, it's just another garbage quote by a talented musician using his popularity to push his own agenda. Shallow."
