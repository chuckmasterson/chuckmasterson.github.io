text: "It was just a comment he made at some point. Most people wouldn't recognize U2 music as having a christian bent, and U2 never pushes that angle. Neil Peart from Rush is always one to proclaim that he is absolutely atheist. I also think he makes great music. Both of them want more for this world and are very heartfelt and opinionated about it. This fuel is evident in their music in my opinion.<br/><br/>Dave"
