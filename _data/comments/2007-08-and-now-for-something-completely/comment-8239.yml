text: "OK my ONE \"junk\" obsession is the stuff you and Micah did in school. That comprised most of the attic stuff. YOUR OLD STUFF.<br/><br/>Micah's got a few junk obsessions. <br/><br/>Your dad has MANY junk obsessions.<br/><br/>If it were up to ME, I WOULD simplify, simplify EXCEPT for the fact that I cannot let go of your old things you made when you were 5. A lot of it is proof of how unique you are. I have pictures of letters you drew when you were 3 ande 4, with little serifs and everything. <br/><br/>Now PLEASE TELL ME, besides my collections of photos, you and your brothers' papers, ANDDDDDDD...my barbies....<br/><br/>What else am I obsessed with?<br/><br/>Grandma has her gaults and her cats. Ellen has her elephants. Chuck has his toy trains. Nana has those long figurines from Spain you can buy at any duty free store (your dad got her those in Spain). Pawpaw has his books, mostly WWII books. Tawnya has, well, collections of everything, especially her hundreds of Longaberger baskets. Micah has his pop cans, beer cans, old bottles, Star Wars toys. YOU have your coins, clocks, and all of these tee shirts, and your many books. Currently YOUR room is the messiest in the new house because you haven't hung up your clothes because \"I'm just going to pack it anyway\". <br/>Yes, your dad has THE MOST and yes, I've tried to throw it away (and often succeeded). But if I were a little old person living here alone, I would have a pretty empty, clean house (living room is pretty much devoid of any objects still). I do NOT like junk. Come to my workplace and I will show you the TIDIEST desk there. Which isn't mine, but mine is probably the second or third tidiest, maybe not THE tidiest, and that's only because it's not the biggest and so a bigger percentage of space is taken by my monster monitor. So THERE.<br/><br/>MOM<br/><br/>\"Simplify, simplify....?\" LOOK AT YOUR ROOM!!!!!  :) :) OLD typewriters. Unused fishtank. Stuff left over from before you read Thoreau. Now you are saying you blame your previous self. LOL"
