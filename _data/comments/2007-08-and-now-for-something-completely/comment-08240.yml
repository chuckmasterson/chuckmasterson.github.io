text: "What's wrong with saying I'm just going to pack them anyway? It's true, isn't it?<br/><br/>Yes, I have a messy room. But almost all of the mess is those clothes that I'm going to pack away as soon as I get a box to replace the one Micah destroyed when he fell on it. I have about four typewriters and five or six clocks. These are messy because we <i>just moved in.</i> I have a terrarium that I never did use for carnivorous plants, but I'm not going to just throw that away; it's perfectly good and I think it cost about $30. One of these days, once I have a job and thus money, and some more free time (Yes, I know about this summer, but I actually <i>was</i> busy most of the time, what with trying and failing to find a job, and reading a bunch of books, and collecting blackberries in the park, and going to Crowduck - and besides, the snake cage and terrarium were locked away for most of the summer anyhow), I'm actually going to do something with the terrarium and snake cage. And the sooner the better. As soon as it's plausible. There is some stuff that I need to shelve, but again, we just moved in. You just watch, I'll organize this stuff like a fiend. And you'll still have your eighty-pound sacks of bulk kindergarten papers (many of which I never even wrote anything on, and many more of which I never wrote anything creative on), and your empty Barbie boxes scattered hither and thither, and your hairstyling implements, and I could go on, but I'm getting bored. And yes, some of the stuff <i>is</i> left over from before I'd heard of Thoreau. How much junk have I accumulated since then? Not a lot. And I've even gotten rid of some of the stuff I had before."
