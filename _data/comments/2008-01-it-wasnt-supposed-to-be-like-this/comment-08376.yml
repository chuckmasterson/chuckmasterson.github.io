text: "Nat,<br/> <br/>I am praying and I want you to know you are not the cause of this, I spoke your mom earlier and hoped to come see her tonight but unfortunately it was not possible but I plan on spending time with her tomorrow. I know you are worried about your mom but this is something she needs to work through you are dealing with things that are stirring her own concerns for you and issues from her past. <br/> <br/>It's good to ask questions unfortunately working through your faith and what you believe can be a long challenging road it is better to ask the questions and work things out within your heart and mind than to ignore them ~ I respect you for searching for answers.<br/><br/>If you need to talk or need anything please let me know and donâ€™t allow what is going on with your mom to inhibit your search for truth she will be ok as she works out her own issues and her own faith. I will do my best to be as supportive as possible and keep you all close to my heart and in my prayers.<br/><br/>love<br/>Vir"
