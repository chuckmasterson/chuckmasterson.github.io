text: "Nathanael,<br/>This is not your fault. It is OK to question everything around you. It is part of growing and maturing and becoming your own identity. You have to find your own path and believe in things because that is how you feel not because someone else is making or telling you to feel that way. It is very empowering to stand for your own beliefs because you searched and figured them out for yourself. Being as educated as possible about your feelings will help you a lot in your life. You are loved by all."
