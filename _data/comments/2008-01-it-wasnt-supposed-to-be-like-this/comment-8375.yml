text: "One of the things you discover as life goes on is that it really isn’t “supposed to be” any particular way as much as you once might have thought.  Sometimes life is just random and you have to figure out how to work with what you get.<br/><br/>It sounds like you tried very hard for a long time to be the kind of person that would make your mother feel like she had done the kind of job that she thought God wanted her to do.  Only you know whether you can go back to doing that.  If you can’t, then you will both need to suffer some pain while you learn a new way to relate.  It is not pleasant to go through, but if you make it, you can have something true and honest on the other side."
