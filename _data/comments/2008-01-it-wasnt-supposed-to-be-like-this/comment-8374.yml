text: "I have been reading this and not commenting to either you or to Ann but...<br/><br/>this is not your fault, DO NOT take it on.  Your questions, growth, self-discoveries and all that are not wrong nor should you feel that her emotional state could have been avoided.  Nervous breakdowns, if you will, are a long time in coming.  It is months or even years of stress building up.  I speak from my own experiance.<br/><br/>Do not limit yourself or stifle yourself because of this.  The last thing a mother wants is for her child to take on her burdens or stop growing out of guilt.  <br/><br/>Part of growing up is to be your own person, not a clone of our parents.  I will face that some day with my own boys.  It is all part of it.<br/><br/>Grow, explore, question, think and live.  Spirituality and faith are personal.  BLIND faith is dangerous.<br/><br/>Toy"
