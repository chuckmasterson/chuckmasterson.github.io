text: "Talking about living in community is really an interesting topic. Now i am working as part time translater on a korean university project. Their project is similiar as saemaul undong ( new village movement) which encourages village to arrange or run a business based on the community. It sounds so cool but also hard to be implemented. Individualism and lack of consideration are the obtacles. Btw, i&#39;ve tried to search your house by google street view. I was little bit wonder after found a garden beside a house. Is that your community&#39;s house? You should check it too.^^"
