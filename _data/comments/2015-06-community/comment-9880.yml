text: "<i>Nothing</i> can work for 7,000,000,000 people in the world. The current system appears to work, but it relies on nonrenewable resources and cannot function without them, and it&#39;s impossible to replace them with renewables because there aren&#39;t enough to go around when losses, transportation, and everything else are accounted for. <br /><br />It&#39;s not just fossil fuels, incidentally. It&#39;s also things like rock phosphate, which is one of the three pillars that conventional agriculture rests on, and which may be peaking within the next 15 years. It&#39;s also topsoil, which is being washed away yearly at the rate of multiple tons per acre. And various other things.<br /><br />But living in community, unequivocally, <i>would</i> work better, for longer, than the current system. It&#39;s the sweet spot: all the right small economies of scale, without the oil-dependent larger ones that will be collapsing soon. It&#39;s the <i>only</i> thing that will work, in the long run. The current system is the most efficient way humanity has ever found to destroy the environment. All of humanity living in community close to the land would cause the environment to breathe a massive, planetary sigh of relief."
