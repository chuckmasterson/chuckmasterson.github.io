text: "So today in my composition seminar there was a brief mention of that spider (Maman) and others made by the same artist (Louise Bourgeois)... they were made as an ode to her mother and the fact that her family wove tapestries. Thought I&#39;d leave that here in case you hadn&#39;t heard the history already. Also, it looks like you caught the spider just in time; it&#39;s apparently been there almost three months and it&#39;ll be leaving March 2nd."
