text: "Ah! By Germanic I meant &quot;native&quot;, because English is a Germanic language. I wasn&#39;t talking about such words as &quot;gesundheit&quot; and &quot;kindergarten&quot;. More like such words as &quot;unbelievable&quot; and &quot;underwater&quot; (compare &quot;incredible&quot; and &quot;subaqueous&quot;). I should&#39;ve cleared that."
