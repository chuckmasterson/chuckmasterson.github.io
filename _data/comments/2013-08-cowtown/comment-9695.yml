text: "I have never been to Calgary but sure would like to see it.  David has been there a few times and I believe liked it a lot.  Between Western B.C. And Banff there is Mt. Revestoke.  The spiral road to the top leads to a huge Alpine meadow, although that is probably done for now, because it is so late.  You need to be very careful around there because there seems to be a lot of  Grzzlies there.  We know that for sure.  Sounds like this leg of the trip is going well."
