text: "Wow!  So glad you made everything work out OK.  It's hard to work, especially when things go so wrong.  But you have true outdoorsman experience, now, and that's the best thing you could do.  Anyway, Bill's help works from 5 AM til the last boat gets off the lake at night and all is cleaned up from that.  And they don't get breaks in the middle.  So if you worked there you'd learn what a day's work is, that's for sure.  Those guys are all the greatest.  Love, Grandma"
