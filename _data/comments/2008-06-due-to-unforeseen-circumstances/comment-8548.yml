text: "Since your family did not get to go, I got to go instead!!!  It definitely wasn't lonely up there, but we missed you, that's for sure!  It was superb fishing, great weather, not too many mosquitoes, yummy food, good companionship, and I couldn't beat your Grandma at Scrabble to save my soul!  Even Sierra won a game.<br/><br/>I'm so glad you've been able to have such a rich experience in the real outdoors, being in charge of young people.  Keep up the good work!<br/><br/>Aunt E."
