text: "Sounds awesome, Aunt Irene. Though I don't really have much time while I'm here. Send a copy on home to me, I guess. <br/><br/>By the way, I didn't do a turn-and-burn after all. Instead I got shuffled around and ended up with time off until tomorrow and time in limbo (CUNOT - Counselor Unassigned Not On Trail - which is where I'm on call to cover for cabins that don't have a counselor) until I leave on the 2nd. Not that you all really are that interested in my minute scheduling details, but I figured I'd let you know why I'm able to post this."
