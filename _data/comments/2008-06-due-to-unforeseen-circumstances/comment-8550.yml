text: "Ello everybody! I'm back from eight straight days on trail. That was pretty sweet. I did two trips, a four- and a five-day, which overlapped to make 8 instead of 9. But now I'm ready for some non-trail food. They give us dehydrated or canned everything. Also they give us summer sausages and American cheese. In some ways, this camp is making me very fit - lots of exercise, lots of sun - but in other ways, not so much: I've probably eaten five or six whole summer sausages since I got on trail, and to quote the bottle of Potable Aqua that we mix into all our drinking water, \"For short term or limited emergency use only.\" I've been drinking PA water for 25 days of the last month. Tonight I'm going with the counselor I just worked with, Big Tim, to a place in Minocqua called Monical's. (\"Monocles?\" I asked.) Just thought I'd give everyone a quick update while I'm here. <br/>Also: Dan, good points."
