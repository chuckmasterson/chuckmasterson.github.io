text: "First off, I’m not trying to be pessimistic, so don’t confuse my message.<br/><br/>I think you should be very careful about trying to work at Crowduck.  If things don't go well, you will have turned your favorite place into a place you hate. Not to mention putting a lot of people in precarious spots.  Not good.  I would suggest trying to get into another fishing camp, the experience would probably be the same, but the risk of losing your sacred vacation spot reduced to nothing.  In addition, if things were to go really bad it could ruin Crowduck for all of us. So I suggest you really think about it from more than just your perspective.  Realize that your actions could have far more consequences than you may originally think.<br/><br/>Dan"
