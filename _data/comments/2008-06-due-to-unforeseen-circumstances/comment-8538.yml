I had already decided not to go, but your dad and Micah were still going to go up until we found out Micah had to go to summer school. <br/><br/>Micah's off grounding today- and yesterday he applied at Kroger's- kid loves to work....he had been grounded for, well, I will tell you later...anywho...<br/><br/>I myself have been, well, physically, a little off, still. <br/><br/>Karl and I had a really good discussion the other day. Will let you know about that, too, in person.<br/><br/>Love you so much. Blessings. LOVE is everywhere. Grab it.<br/><br/>Mom"
