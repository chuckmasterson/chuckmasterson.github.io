text: "I forgot about that altogether. Crowduck is a bit lonely this year, eh? Man, would it be cool if I got to work there next year. I think I could handle that. Probably it would be a nightmare of paperwork (foreign work visa, etc.), but I'm prepared to deal with that if Bill's looking for a bit of help. And hey, I would gain a good amount when I changed it back to American funds, because the US dollar is so low. Maybe it's a pipe dream, but when I finally get my driver's license this summer after I get back from camp, I'm still going to write Bill."
