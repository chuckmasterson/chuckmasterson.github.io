text: "That sounds a lot like some place I went to on vacation somewhere.  Don't think it was in Cincinnati though, probably Kentucky.  It was a few years back, but I remember going out on a bridge that was marked that you weren't allowed to go on it. It led to a concrete/stone tower in the middle of a lake or river and you could see all around.  I remember on the far side there was a forest, and on the other was the parking lot that the bridge was connected to.  Later we went on a hiking trail very close by and saw a creek raging past.  It was fenced in and had stone walls, but they were only <br />maybe 10 feet high or less.  Its weird how similar my experience was to yours.<br /><br />P.S. Why weren't you at school Monday and Tuesday?  Its not like you to be sick, so did I forget something?"
