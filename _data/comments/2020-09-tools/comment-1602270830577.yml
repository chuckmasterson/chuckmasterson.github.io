text: "No, I drained all the oil out of the transmission, and put a bunch of new engine oil in the engine without draining it, thinking I already had. When I figured it out, I filled the transmission with the right transmission fluid, found the engine drain and drained that, and refilled the engine with engine oil.\r\n\r\nOne of these years I may end up looking for a new transmission. At that point I'm sure I'll have to find someone's advice on how to tell whether a transmission is any good if the truck it's in is dead! As for installing it, though, I imagine it'll be way cheaper to pay a shop that has the equipment to drop the transmission and put in the new one, rather than try and maneuver a few hundred pounds of steel from a prone position."
