  So you put engine oil in the transmission? You’re probably going to have some
  ‘problems’ soon. A used transmission is cheap since it’s such an old truck.
  You can learn to go ‘junking ‘ now. I always really enjoyed junkyards. Every
  junked car is a story and junkyards are kind of like free museums. You might
  consult a transmission shop and flush the fluid, which could help. Another tip
  from one cheap car owner to another is that manual transmissions are cheaper
  and easier to maintain.
