text: "Sure, driving is a craft. I&#39;m not trying to deny that. But among human crafts, it stands out for its potential for lethality, in a way that writing and whittling really don&#39;t. <br /><br />The fact that you haven&#39;t bent metal yet means you&#39;re lucky and skilled, but not invincible. Even behind the yoke of a plane, you are at base a squishy organism at the whims of such things as geese that fly into engines."
