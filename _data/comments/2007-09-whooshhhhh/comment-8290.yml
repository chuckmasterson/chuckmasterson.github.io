text: "No, I wouldn't, but I would be interested in how you determined your answer. If you use any unfounded and un-provable beliefs in the computation of your answer, I would consider the answer to be a theory. However I would respect your theory, and challenge you to seek for provable facts with repeatable outcomes before professing your theory as fact, or pushing your theory as an answer in which to live by."
