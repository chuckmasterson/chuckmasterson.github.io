I'm scared he might figure out a bunch of stuff and I personally don't want him coming home from college smarter and more open-minded than me.  Well, crap, I'm too late on the smarter part, maybe even the open-minded part.  Well I guess your progress is unstoppable.  I suppose you've already figured out that you can and should objectively challenge all of the things you've been lead to believe and decide for yourself.  That's the toughest part of open-mindedness.  I'm sure you'll master it too.<br/><br/>I have to say, I’m jealous of your college lifestyle. But not jealous of the schoolwork! Yuk! Oh, and like Dave, Joe and even yo-momma to an extent, we were like your roommates.  I would suggest not to ignore the parties, but you can attend and not drink, you might get ridiculed a few times, but eventually your true friends will shine through and they won’t bother you about not boozing it up with them. Oh, and it’s fun to watch otherwise normal people become driveling idiots over just a couple hours. Oh, that’s right, you have plenty experience witnessing that (Crowduck).<br/><br/>Dan"
