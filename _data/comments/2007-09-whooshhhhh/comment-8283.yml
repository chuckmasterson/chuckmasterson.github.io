text: "What exactly IS open-minded? I've been asking myself that for a long time. For some people it's a catchall for anything goes. \"Open-minded\" has this present-day connotation of accepting everything and anything as right, and anyone who actually decides that one thing is right or one thing is wrong is branded as closed-minded. It lives our culture with perpetual questions and blind acceptance of anything, be it subjective OR objective.<br/><br/>Saying \"open-minded\" without clarifying is just a cop-out for people to AVOID thinking or processing information, filtering, and finding answers. It's an excuse for people to feel good about being lazy and avoid making decisions.<br/><br/>It's all beside the point. Nathanael listens to a lot of stuff and experiments with the viability of ideas, as you see. <br/><br/>And as for \"normal people becoming driveling idiots\"- I would have to make a correction: \"already driveling idiots becoming drivelinger idiots\".<br/><br/>Mom<br/>I will stand corrected on the grammatical point, BUT I believe Strunk & White would side with me. An object pronoun does NOT sound right."
