I had to do that liiiiitle edit.<br/><br/>Regarding the paleo diet- I think it's a noble thing that you tried it. There are some valid observations in this guy's writings. But there is also much more. And those Paleos didn't live too long, either. <br/><br/>I would say that the best diet consists of as many unprocessed foods as possible. By that I mean food that you haven't altered by heating or any other chemistry. That is what I learned when your grandpa had that impacted gunk removed. People who hunt and forage NOw rather than living in settlements have 10x as much waste but an almost nonexistent rate of diverticulitis and other lack-of-fiber ailments. Can you live this way only by giving up 100% of wheat/barley/rice/oats/corn? Maybe not entirely. But these people just eat a LOT of raw vegetables and fruits. It's not necessarily Paleo. Many people live that way NOW."
