text: "Well said, BJ. It's kind of moot at the time anyhow; we've had the Agricultural Revolution, and the effects are pretty inescapable. Even if, say, Jason Godesky is a fanatic, he's acknowledged that he will always be on \"the fringe of a fringe\", and not able to really make much change in the world, even if he wanted to. I don't actually know much about Jared Diamond, but Godesky did cite that article in that stuff I read, and I thought it was something I could use to accurately sum up the viewpoint of the people who advocate the Paleo diet. In fact, I didn't even read the article until after I posted the blog. I'm trying not to be a fanatic. I think my next post will be interesting in this general vein of discussion.<br/>Mom: \"Than\" is a preposition. It isn't restricted to having a clause after it; a noun can do okay too. Insisting on \"better than he is\" is akin to insisting on \"It is I\" instead of \"It's me\". It may have been some grammarian's rule at some point, but language evolves, and grammarians often make rules for irrational reasons. (The end-of-sentence preposition rule was created by an odd grammarian in I think the 1600s, who based the rule on Latin, for no good reason, even though people had been putting their prepositions at the end of sentences for centuries. It's never been a rule that needs to be obeyed at all.)"
