Ouch!<br/><br/>I think you are doing great Nathanael, welcome to college, the best 5 or 6 years of your life. A creed your roomates are sure to follow. Also a creed a few of your idiot relatives may have followed for awhile.<br/><br/>I like that you are thinking outside of the box. You are young the world is open, take some risks! Try the paleo diet, try the agrarian diet, hell try the breatharian diet! Don't let anybody put your mind in a box.<br/><br/>Dave"
