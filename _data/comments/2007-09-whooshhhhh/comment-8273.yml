text: "Easy Nathanael, be careful with this Paleo stuff.  Jared Diamond's a smart guy, but his word is not gospel, just like the words of any other famous scientist shouldn't be taken as the complete unvarnished truth.  Saying the Agricultural Revolution was the greatest mistake in human history is fine and dandy, but by what yardstick?  In terms of sustainability, perhaps.  But in terms of human lives and opportunities?  There are many more yardsticks that need to be measured than are perhaps in Mr. Diamond's toolbag.  You only choose one metric to judge an event, and you risk becoming a fanatic of one sort or another."
