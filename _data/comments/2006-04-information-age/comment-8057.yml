text: "I recomment iTunes.  If it won't import to your mp3 player you can at least rip all your CD's into it. Since it then stores the files locally you should be able to move them to a directory that will upload to the player.  As for realplayer files, your guess is as good as mine.<br/><br/>Please feel free to send your storms back out west.  They missed us and we miss them terribly.  They have work to do here."
