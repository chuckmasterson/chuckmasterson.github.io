text: "I'm pretty sure Windows Media Player can Sync music up to your mp3 player.  I know it can rip any CDs you may want in a file format.  As for transforming your Real files into mp3, first make sure you've actually downloaded the file and not a shortcut.  Must websites now imbed a shortcut to the actual file inside the file they actually link to.  For example, you sent me the link http://www.fjhmusic.com/audio/cm7001.ram for Central Junction, but the actual file is located at http://www.fjhmusic.com/audio/rm/cm7001.rm<br/><br/>Next, Google something along the lines of \".ram to .mp3\" (Without the quotes may actually give you better results though) or go to Download.com and enter the same thing.  That should give you a slew of programs that will do what you need.  Remember that old clock changing trick I told you about a while back and you should even be able to use the \"trials\" limitlessly.  I've come across one program that detected this trick, but I think most of them will still fall for it."
