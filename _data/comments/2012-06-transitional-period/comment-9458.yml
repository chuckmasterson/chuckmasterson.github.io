text: "Awesome as it sounds to meet a real Siberian, time is short already and I&#39;d have to take at least a full day to stop and see him, since the train waits for no one. Maybe more, depending on how far he lives from any particular stop. Although, if he lives in Irkutsk, there&#39;s the chance I might be stopping there... any idea where he&#39;s located in Siberia these days?"
