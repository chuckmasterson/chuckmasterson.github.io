text: "Sorry I let myself get so scared about Russia. I just hear so many things but I know how those things can get blown out of proportion. Believe me because when I lived in Colombia EVERYTHING was blown out of proportion by the time it got to the US. Anywho, I don&#39;t know if you remember but we had a Russian from Siberia stay with us for a while when you were a little kid. If I can look him up, maybe you can catch up with him. The last time he saw you was when you were about two.<br />Love you, MOM<br />PS Remember it&#39;s my job to worry about gangs, aliens, monsters, tyrants, and werewolves coming after you."
