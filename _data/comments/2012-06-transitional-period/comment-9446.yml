text: "Keeping clean is a bridge that I figure I&#39;ll cross when I come to it. There probably won&#39;t be one single solution. Couchsurfing might help. That&#39;s when you use www.couchsurfing.com to connect to someone in your target city and see if they&#39;ll let you stay in their house in exchange for you doing their dishes and telling them stories. So if I do some of that I&#39;ll have access to showers. Otherwise, there are such things as: truck stop showers, scrubbing with a shirt at a bathroom sink, bathing in rivers and lakes, and taking a shower from a bottle held up with one hand. I&#39;ll be washing my clothes in sinks."
