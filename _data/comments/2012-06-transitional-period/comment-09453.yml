text: "Holy moly! I can comment now I&#39;m not at work. Woop!<br /><br />I just wanted to drop in and let everyone know that the world isn&#39;t a scary, dangerous place. Sure, it can be, sometimes, but most of the time no matter what country you&#39;re in you&#39;ll find yourself among kind, helpful and hospitable people. <br /><br />Tour guides, travel agents and other pundits will often advise their patrons to stay in at night, to not steer too far off the beaten track, to stay locked up in their hotel rooms, if they let on that you could do everything on your own, and not have to worry, they wouldn&#39;t be able to charge as much as they do and they may well put themselves out of a job. <br /><br />Russia is one of the safest and easiest places to hitchhike in all of Europe. I&#39;m staying with a family when I visit Russia shortly after Nathanael, they live in the suburbs of Moscow on an estate. I&#39;d better watch out I suppose. They might kill me. I&#39;d best not get in their car when they give me a free ride from the train station. They might take me hostage. <br /><br />Spread the love. Lay off the hate. The world and its people are mostly beautiful. We shouldn&#39;t let rare cases get in the way of experiencing how amazing life can be.
