text: "Do some more research.  When we were in Russia they advised to stay close to hotel and never go out alone.  I can&#39;t convince you but I am right.  You will never get in the car.  In a country where there is nothing to lose, they have nothing to lose.  The biggest problem is that you will not know where it is safe.  The wisest people are the best listeners."
