text: "I think keeping clean is just a bridge that I&#39;m going to cross when I come to it. It&#39;ll probably be a bunch of different strategies. Couchsurfing might be one of the more useful ones. That&#39;s when you use www.couchsurfing.com to find people in your target city who are willing to let you sleep in their place for a night in exchange for you telling them stories and doing the dishes and whatever. So if I do some of that, on those nights I&#39;ll have showers available. Otherwise, such things as: truck stop showers, bathing in streams and lakes, scrubbing with a wet shirt at a bathroom sink, and just being dirty sometimes, though I&#39;d like to avoid that. (Not least because no one wants to pick up a filthy hitchhiker.) I&#39;ll do laundry in bathroom sinks, most likely. <br /><br />I might find the time to do part of the AT while I&#39;m in the US... but then again I might not. There are interesting people everywhere, though.<br /><br />Momâ€”here&#39;s a little anecdote about hitchhiking. I was on an internet forum today about hitchhiking, the sort of place where big news would pop up. Someone posted a link to a story about a hitchhiker who was shot randomly in the arm by a motorist in Montana, while cooking his dinner beside the road. Then, a couple comments later, someone else found the latest on the story: the hitchhiker was a photojournalist working on a project called <i>The Kindness of America</i>, and evidently he was also a bit wacky, because he confessed that he actually shot <i>himself</i>, apparently in a bizarre attempt at self-promotion. So, the only story of violence against a hitchhiker that I&#39;ve recently found (not that I&#39;ve been looking all that hard) turned out to be carried out by the hitchhiker against his own stupid self. I don&#39;t think you need to worry too much."
