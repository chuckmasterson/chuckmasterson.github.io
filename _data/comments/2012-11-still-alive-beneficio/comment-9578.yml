text: "I am very interested to hear more. I am jealous of your pilgrimage . And as an uncle, I wasn&#39;t worried at all. You&#39;re living life to the fullest, make no apologies.  I know you are looking forward to coming home, but you&#39;re missing nothing of consequence.  Cincituky  soldiers on at an ever changeless pace. We all have &#39;BSFS&#39; , battleground state fatigue syndrome. The cold civil war continues. When you get back it will be more or the same, or more of the same with a different wrapper.<br /><br />Dave"
