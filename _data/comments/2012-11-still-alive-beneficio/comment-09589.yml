text: "I believe a penthouse in Granada could also be arranged, though it might not be as penty as some penthouses, since there aren&#39;t skyscrapers here.<br /><br /><i>Flight Behavior</i> might be an interesting read. I&#39;ve never read any Kingsolver, but she&#39;s certainly popular. As it happens, though, I have a long list of other books I want to read when I have the chance. I&#39;ll probably spend like a month just reading book after book, when I get home. I&#39;m looking at the list now and the count is up to nineteen, plus a few maybes. I just bought one to knock off the list, but it&#39;s hard finding the titles I&#39;m after in countries where the English books are a tiny portion of the bookstore. Well, I&#39;m planning on being in England in a few weeks, and Sean works in a bookstore, so I imagine I&#39;ll get some satisfaction there, anyhow."
