text: "Sitting around the fire in the Big Tipi, I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about mundane old Cincinnati, and the not-very-adventurous basement in Grandma and Grandpa&#39;s house, and all those boring old things that I miss so much. I&#39;ll make it, but hopefully it won&#39;t be through six weeks of thinking about Christmas dinner every night while I go to sleep. Wish I could be there for Thanksgiving - and that goes for Nana &amp; Papaw, too, if you&#39;re reading. I kind of even wish I could vote, but it&#39;s not looking too likely that I&#39;ll find an American embassy with a ballot box in this little town in the Alpujarra. Tomorrow night I believe I&#39;m sleeping in a cave in Granada with a guy named Benito... catch you there, or if the cave has no internet, whenever!"
