text: "O.K.  Dave has one man&#39;s opinion.  I am however, the eternal optimist.  Life will flourish wherever one nurtures it and believes in it.  Life goes on as they say.  No I do not know who &quot;they are but I now that I am one of them.  Glad to here from you and I agree with Dave, you are living life to the fullest and making an old grandpa wish he was 50 years younger and could do the same thing.  It is cold today in Oxford and although a couple of days ago we had about 5 minutes of sleet there is no snow on the ground.  We are now planning our traditional turkey feast for thanksgiving, with all of the goodies like scalloped oysters, turkey dressing, fresh rolls Grandma Blaser salad, brussel sprouts, and of course Turkey.  Pre-feast goodies will include shrimp, pickled herring, anchovies and a yet unnamed new goodie.  It&#39;s a secret, in fact so secret, even I do not know what it is as of this writing.  If you get to Florence, be sure to go see THE David.  It is an emotional experience or at least it was for me.  Oh Yeah it would make your mother very happy, who worries much more than she should, if you could blog more often.  Yeah, I know sometimes it is impossible.  Grandpa"
