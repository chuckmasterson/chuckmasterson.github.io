text: "We will do everything we can to give you the homecoming you deserve.  I&#39;ll get going on the ginger snaps, for sure.  How about a roast pork, mashed potatoes and gravy, broccoli, bread, salad and homemade apple pie?  That&#39;s what your brother and mom had here on Sunday.  Also his new girlfriend, and Dan and Cammy and Cory.  We are showing them pictures of you but I fear they won&#39;t recognize you when you get home.  Won&#39;t take long for them to warm up to you though.  Anyway, enjoy the rest of your time in Europe.  There&#39;s more adventure to be had.  Grandma"
