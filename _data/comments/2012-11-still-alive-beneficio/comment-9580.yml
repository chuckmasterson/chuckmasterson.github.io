text: "I&#39;m already looking forward to hearing about your adventures on your pilgrimage.  I can&#39;t quite imagine it, but I&#39;ve always wanted to know more about it.  Hope you studied the architecture of the church.  It&#39;s really old, and from the pictures I&#39;ve seen, it looks really interesting from that point of view.  <br /><br />Election is tomorrow, and we&#39;ll all be glad it&#39;s at least over, no matter who wins.  The world will still revolve either way.  <br />I agree with Grandpa--the more posts you can put up, the less your mother and grandmother will worry.  Remember, we can&#39;t stop it.  That&#39;s just the way we are.<br /><br />We met Micah&#39;s girlfriend last night, and she&#39;s a charmer.  Hope he keeps her around!  Grandma"
