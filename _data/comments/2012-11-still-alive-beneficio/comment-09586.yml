text: "Oooooh. That sounds pretty much perfect. At some point, a ribs dinner might also be called for.<br /><br />I can&#39;t wait to see Cammy and Cory! It&#39;ll be weird to see them about twice their former size. <br /><br />Benito&#39;s cave is a pretty darn nice place. The story is that in the 1900s, gypsies started digging these caves into the steep rock wall near the city, and using them as free housing. Nowadays they&#39;re still around, but populated more by rebels than by gypsies. Most of them are still rent-free, too. Benito&#39;s is. He turned out to be an actor, so last night I was treated to a performance in a bar, about which none of the patrons had previous notification, of &quot;Lope and Calderón&quot;, in which Benito played both Lope and Calderón, two men in a bar who talk about life. Lope is a sailor who thinks money is what you need, and Calderón is a sort of poet with different ideas, though I didn&#39;t understand it all, since my Spanish still has a ways to come before I can catch everything.<br /><br />By the way, Granada is probably now winning the prize for &quot;favorite European city&quot;, and is the only place so far that I&#39;ve pictured myself moving to. I could have a cave of my own, and come down and mingle with the college crowd, and go for tapas at the bars at night..."
