text: "lamont again, this time on a more serious note.  After reading your post i figured i had to tell you.  I go to a different school now, as you prb know.  Apon arival, they asked me where i had gone to school before, i said, finneytown secondary cumpus.  The school board looked at me baffled.  As you may guess, ive been placed in the first grade.  the credits i earned at finneytown where actually not school creds, but discount coupons for a steak dinner that expired around 97'.  The math i thought i completly understood, as actually only taught to me effectively, not correctly.  this to me was a total bum bum.  When asked to perform simple math equations i found myself changing the subject to the weather. for instance, they asked me what 3! was in a decimal, and I asked if they had ever enjoyed a can of beans, the magical fruit.  When that line doesnt work i normally throw somthing and yell \"what was that?\" and franticly jump out of the window.  By the way, i talked to jim, the guy that did finneytowns sidewalks, and he said that the dreams were not completely broken.  The truth is finneytowns teachers or \"monitors\" actually get paid to destroy all dream life forms, but since they can only perform this \"effectively\" instead of excellent, they just pave the sidewalks with the practically broken dreams to make sure that they are trapped and paved dowm forever.  and then there was the prb with my gpa.  It was my belief that finneytown had actually been keeping track of my grades.  Turns out, my grade point was just mr. Crawleys High Score on his cell phone video game \"snake\"( he must suck at it).  Then, like the guy on csi, i started getting suspicios.  I looked for the school map Quest, but it was no where to be found.  I tried to find when the school had opened up, but there was no school in Ohio under that name... thats when i realized something definatly smelled fishy.  so i changed my socks and continued my research.  The computer was on, and so was the simpons, thats when it came to me, What is finneytown is the worlds first humanized Skinner Box.  The thought over whelmed me and i instantly fainted into a distant dream world( the ones mrs otten didnt halfway destroy).  I awoke several hours later in a all white room.  The government somehow knew what i had stummbled on.  They told me i was the first to find out what ft really was...  A monitoring psychology experiment.  Thats right, all of us have made Lab rats of ourselves for as long as we have been in school.  They have monitored to see what the human brain can be convinced is Reality.  He told me that in the <br/>future, Finneytown will just be a show where people think they're just living thier lives and getting an education, while the whole world laughs at us.  This is the biggest scandel that america has seen since the mob.  Whats next? our Children? no.. they all ready got them...  They attempted to erase my memory with the will smith stick, but a perfectly timed blink saved all my knowlege from a sure cease of existance.  I must try to keep this a secret, for i fear for my life.  The future of the finneytowns education is in your hands now chuck, and this time its forreal... and no free refills either.  Spread the word, stand up and get out of this mind controling skinner box and revolt in the street.  They thought they would get away with this, Well let it be known that they will rue this day now and forever.  As for me, i must return to my post as a first grader, relearning my words and concepts, my grasp on reality is slowly tighting.  the lesson plan this week is some type of alein tech called \"show n tell\".  I have not yet mastered the technique, but i am a level 5 shape pointer outer(not to brag).  I must stay here in the dark, i must not be discovered.  I must stay brave, though daymares attack my sanity at naptime, i have faith that you will pull threw the dark cave of deception into the lush meadow of flowering honesty.  The search for the truth is almost over chuck, stay strong.  Remember a candle flickers most violently just before it goes out. dont believe the lie sandwhiches they give you for lunch with one slice of truth, open your mouth to a delicious new mouthful of dignified truth, now in cherry, blue berry, watermelon, and sour apple flavors.  Stand strong chuck, you and Keith might be the secondary cumpuses only hope.  This is lamont letting you know that your school is a myth. Rodger, do you read me? rodger?! thats a big ten four... Rodger, over and out.."
