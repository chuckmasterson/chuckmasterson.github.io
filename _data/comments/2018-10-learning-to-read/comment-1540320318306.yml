  My brother and I trapped muskrat, mink, and gophers when we were young. Did
  great trapping gophers but muskrats and mink were slim pickings.  The county
  paid 10 cents for each pair of front feet for gophers.  Not bad since I could
  go to a movie for a dime up to and including age twelve.  Happy hunting and
  trapping.
