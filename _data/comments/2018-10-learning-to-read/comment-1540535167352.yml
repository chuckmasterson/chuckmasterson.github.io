  Yeah, I plan to try it---once I legally can. I was talking to a guy just
  before I left Washburn, about my age, who had come to the house to hunt grouse
  in the woods behind it. That sounded pretty interesting too, and I may try
  that one day. He told me he'd teach me to hunt deer with a bow. It sounds like
  I'll soon be learning a lot more about how to get meat from the woods, and
  understand the animals who live there.
