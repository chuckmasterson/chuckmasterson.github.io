text: "Think of it this way - under your sock or shoe or both you have a bare foot.  It is all a matter of perspective.  It is true that it is always sunny in the daytime if you are at the right altitude.  On the otherhand I do not really care to eat my cheesy lasagna while looking at a bare foot with a 1/4 of an inch of toe jam under the nail - not your toe or mine but the other persons.  That's my story and I'm stickin' to it.  GPa.  P.S.  I'm surprised that 22 % like toe jam."
