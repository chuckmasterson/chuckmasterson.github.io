text: "So sorry to hear that \"discalzedeness\" (I know that's NOT the word but I do forget the actual word, though I do remember that \"defenestrate\" means \"to exit through a window\") was not accepted with zeal by the Pioneers. However, it may be that you picked a difficult time for it, and the Obamabots, Clintonistas, and McCainanites just didn't pay attention amidst their own internal warfare. Seems they fight with their shoes on and armed.<br/><br/>Well I FOR ONE hope you can someday eat at the cafeteria with your shoes off, but don't count on it. I guess you're finding out that no matter where you go to school, the dual hounds of apathy and entropy stalk viciously. As they prowl and devour, you may consider wearing sandals, at least inside, for now. <br/><br/>I love you and your snowman rawks!<br/>Mom"
