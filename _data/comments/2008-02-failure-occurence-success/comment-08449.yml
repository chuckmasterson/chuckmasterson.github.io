text: "Wow, that's pretty good. We've had a lot of good storms, but none of them were quite that big. Consistency, though: we've had storms like twice a week since December. That's overstated, but not drastically. I'm happy with the winter I got. Yours is good too, but more in a \"flash in the pan\" way."
