text: "We must travel in different loops, because I&#39;ve never heard of those last two. I went to Goodwill today and got myself a $7 suit coat, so the Dal√≠ costume isn&#39;t too far from being reality; I&#39;m just a mustache away. But if that doesn&#39;t pan out, the Zappa costume is a good backup. They didn&#39;t have any red-and-white striped shirts, which was disappointing. They did have a shirt I could use for Weird Al, but I didn&#39;t feel like curling my hair."
