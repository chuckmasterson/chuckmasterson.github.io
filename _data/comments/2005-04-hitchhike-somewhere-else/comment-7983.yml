text: "Pardon my comment, but I figured it obscure only because I've only heard about it maybe once and know nothing more about it.  Probably doesn't help that I'm not in contact with a great number of people even living in the 70s.  I'll have to look further into this now that it seems that I wasn't just drawing a musical group out of some random Nathanael quote."
