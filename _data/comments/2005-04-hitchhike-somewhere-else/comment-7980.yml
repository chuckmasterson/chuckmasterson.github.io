text: "Judas Priest!  Obscure!  Holy Moly youngsters!  ;-)  They were less than obscure in their day, um that would be the 70's.  Actually they are still touring.  Eek, tell me you know who Ozzy Osborne is, besides the drugged out reality show guy.<br/><br/>Too bad about HHGTHG being such a bomb.  I remember (vaugly) the books as being very entertaining."
