text: "I&#39;ve actually never had jjamppong. If I had to pick something that&#39;s like cheeseburgers, it&#39;d probably have to be kimbap—rice rolls. They look like sushi, but instead of fish in the middle, they have pickled radish, various long veggies, and usually either ham or tuna, though you can also make them with kimchi. Or maybe tteokbokki, which is rice logs and squares of pounded fish in hot red sauce. I&#39;ll keep an eye out for jjamppong, though. I&#39;m not a good person to tell you about seafood stuff yet, because I&#39;ve kind of been avoiding it so far, but I think over the course of the year I&#39;m going to try to build myself up to be a fish person. Like, someone who eats fish, not—someone with gills. Sean is a huge fish person (that is, he&#39;s a very tall person with gills), and he&#39;s trying to persuade us all to go out tonight for hoe, which I think is something like sushi (and pronounced hweh—don&#39;t know if you all memorized my Korean pronunciation guide back in August), so I might go along and try that out. <br /><br />I don&#39;t have a phone number, but you know what I do have, is Skype. This is a program that you can download for free from skype.com, and then you can use it as a phone for totally free, plus you can also have video chats, also totally free. That&#39;s what I&#39;d figured on for Christmas—a video chat, so I can see all of you and you can see me."
