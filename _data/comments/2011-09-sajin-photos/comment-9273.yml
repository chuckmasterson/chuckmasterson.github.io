text: "I agree with Grandpa!  Those pictures are amazing.  Keep them coming.  I assume you took the zip line, but no pictures of it?<br /><br />How about some pictures of your school, too.  And maybe of that food you like so well.  I will bet if you sent the recipe, if you can find one, we wouldn&#39;t be able to find the ingredients.  Well, maybe at Jungle Jim&#39;s.<br /><br />It is good to know that you are having such a wonderful experience.  Love you.  Grandma"
