text: "I haven&#39;t ever heard what dakgalbi is but I suspect I would like it! I always get a soup at a local (Dayton) chinese restaurant that is owned by Koreans so it has a special Korean menu (in Korean text, well characters) called &quot;jam-pong&quot;. According to the guy I used to work with that introduced it to me, It&#39;s like cheeseburgers in America... you can get it anywhere.<br /><br />Regardless, I will be disappointed if you don&#39;t really take note of the cuisine over there and bring it home. with my dietary limitations, I am always in need of more seafood based chow. Or tofo, hehehe"
