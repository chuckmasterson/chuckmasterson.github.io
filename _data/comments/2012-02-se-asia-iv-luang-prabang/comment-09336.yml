I am thrilled by the encounters you have had.  I am surprised by the number of english speaking (Brits, Americans) with whom have met and interacted.  As a foodie, I am extremely jealous of all the goodies you are consuming.  I love to try new things.  I look forward to you next installment.   G.Pa."
