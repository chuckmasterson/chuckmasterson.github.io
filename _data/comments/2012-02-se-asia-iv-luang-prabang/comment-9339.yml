text: "Hm... I could take a look at the foreigners&#39; bookstore in Seoul, I suppose. But I haven&#39;t been using oneâ€”I just use <a  rel=\"nofollow\">www.maangchi.com</a>. It&#39;s pretty good; she has videos for every recipe. Only thing is she sometimes uses lots of ingredients and time-consuming techniques. If you don&#39;t have the ingredients she calls for, or unlimited time, you can usually search around the internet for other recipes and get a feel for what you can cut out without too much detriment to the food. (One site I&#39;ve used for this is <a  rel=\"nofollow\">mykoreankitchen.com</a>, which has most of the same recipes.)"
