text: "Thanks! Yeah, English speakers are all over the place in these countries. They love it there because the countries are so cheap. I was pretty happy about that too. It&#39;s not just Americans and Brits and Australians, though. I met a lot of continental Europeansâ€”Germans, Austrians, French, a few Spaniards. And there are the Asians too, Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans, except that they tend to be more monolingual and generally hang out with people from their own countries. When you go backpacking you meet people from every part of the developed world. <br /><br />I&#39;ll try to get in a few good descriptions of food. I&#39;ve kinda just been calling them delicious, but some of my favorite moments in Daniel Pinkwater&#39;s books are where he talks about delicious (or disgusting) food. Not many other authors seem to do that... maybe I can do some secondary pioneering."
