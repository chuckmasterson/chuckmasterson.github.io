text: "Viki, Alex and I went to the Donauschwaben Oktoberfest. There was a whole lot of Gem√ºtlichkeit there, too, which as I understand it means there are so many people packed into such a small area that they must have their senses dulled by alcohol or a riot would ensue. We were there for an hour or so until Alex&#39;s ears started bleeding from listening to German music. We, luckily, did not have to escape to the Czech Republic."
