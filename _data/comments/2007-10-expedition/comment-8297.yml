text: "I don't think there's any such thing as \"beat me to it\" when it comes to ginger cookies.  It simply calls for an unending supply.  Anyway, mine are store-bought and not the grandma kind.  I'm sure with you on the beauty of Iowa.  I remember driving from Grinnell to Davenport with Jack one year, '96 I think, and coming up over the top of a rise when you couldn't see anything in the distance beyond it because of the hill, and there was nothing on the hill but prairie grass, and I said \"Now, isn't that beautiful?\"  and I meant it.  Jack looked at me kind of wonderingly.  He grew up here where there's lots of trees and hills blocking your view of everything, including the sky, and he always said Iowa was flat, but I knew better.<br/>Irene"
