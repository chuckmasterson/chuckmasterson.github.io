text: "Wait, what? It looks like my other comment got lost in cyberspace. And it was long, too. Okay. Let's see if I can remember it.<br/><br/>\"Looks like their site is down, probably temporarily. The main '<a>www.extremecroquet.org</a>' address isn't working either.<br/>\"Dave, that was excellent. I never really thought of losing smells in winter before. Though I do remember years ago getting up one day and knowing clearly from the smell that it was the first day of winter. (I mark seasons by the smells, not by irrelevantly abstract stuff like equinoxes. Have I written about this somewhere else?) Maybe winter has a smell, or maybe it was just the sharp absece of one that I noticed. I'll try and figure it out this winter.\""
