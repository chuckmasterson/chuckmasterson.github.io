text: "Well, you will get no cookies from me. If you want any, you may need to use those illegal means you hinted about. About a week and a half ago, I went right over the top of you at 45,000 ft. I wish I would have had a camera, I could have taken a picture of the old farm, which was nothing but a small smudge as was Melbourne.<br/><br/>I had another unique experience the other day flying over Cleveland at 40,000 ft., I could clearly make out Venus in the sky before me at three in the afternoon. It couldn't have been more than 30 azimuth from the sun.<br/><br/>One of the things I don't like about winter is the wind losing all of its olefactory character. When the temperature is 0 and the relative humidity at like 20%, outdoors doesn't smell like anything.<br/><br/>Some people hate humidity, but I love it, it really brings the outside world to life.<br/><br/>Dave"
