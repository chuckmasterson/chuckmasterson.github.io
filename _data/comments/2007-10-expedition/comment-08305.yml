text: "I'm certainly glad to hear all your positive news about your life at Grinnell.  Keep it up!  (And no, I didn't send any ginger snaps.)<br/><br/>Just one thing worries me.  The last time I was at Rock Creek State Park (where I got a diamond ring, so I do remember it vividly), it was WEST of Grinnell, not east.  Now normally I wouldn't even mention that, but I just received the fall issue of \"The Grinnell Magazine\", and on page 6 they report that the Iowa Speedway near Newton is 25 miles east of Grinnell.  So now I'm wondering, has Grinnell turned the map upside-down?  Please don't get lost!!<br/><br/>Just FYI, another error on page 20 refers to Grant Wood's American Gothic, describing it as a stark image of an American farm couple.  One does not normally describe a father and daughter, the actual subjects of the painting, as a \"couple\".<br/><br/>Anyway, do you ever see that magazine?  It's sent to alumni as a \"send money quick\" plea.  But the fall issue really has some wonderful material on Iowa land and its history.<br/><br/>Aunt E."
