text: "Got the ginger snaps today; they&#39;re delicious. Off to Cahokia in a few minutes with my archaeology class. Cahokia is an archaeological site, but once a year they hold a primitive-skills sort of gathering, with an emphasis on atlatls. That&#39;s what I&#39;ll be doing this weekend. Afterwards, I&#39;ll write another blog here. Say≈çnara!"
