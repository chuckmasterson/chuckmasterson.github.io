text: "Glad you have made some pasties.  I&#39;m going to try them too, when we get back from Egypt.  Let me know how you spice them up.  I&#39;m gonna try to make those cookies tomorrow.  Don&#39;t hold your breath, though, because we&#39;re also going to your house for dinner, with Carl cooking, I suppose.  Thanks for putting in those pictures.  It really helps to see your environment.  Grandma"
