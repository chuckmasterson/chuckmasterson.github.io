text: "I remember being 21 1/2 and going to St. Louis to meet up with some of the kids I&#39;d gone to Peru with the previous summer.  We were walking around St. Louis and felt thirsty, so decided to go into a nearby lounge and have cokes.  They would not even let me in the door, although I only wanted to buy a soft drink, was of legal age, and had a driver&#39;s license to prove it.  My license didn&#39;t have a picture in those days.  I should have brought my passport.  Still, there was no moving them.  I was denied my legal rights, and I was absolutely furious.  But it was only because I was so new an adult, and really did still look like a 14-year-old, that I was so mad.  When I got to 26 and the same sort of thing happened, I took it as a compliment.  At 26 I played the part of a 14-year-old on stage, and people would come up to me afterward and talk to me as if I was really 14.  That was a very high compliment.  Alas, I haven&#39;t been carded in many a long year, but then I never drink alcohol anyway.  It doesn&#39;t matter, as long as you know who you are.  <br /><br />P.S.  Hard to give up a dream, I know.  When I was four years old and needed some new shoes, we found some beautiful red ones, with straps, that I fell in love with.  So they were a little tight, so what?  But Mom asked me to tell her the truth, and I admitted they were too snug, so however I cried and pleaded, I didn&#39;t get them.  Therever after I wanted and wanted red shoes with straps. If I had gotten them at the time, I would have put them on once, and then thrown them into the back of the closet, my love affair over.  As it was, I finally found some when I was nearly 30, and I bought them, wore them once, and then threw them into the back of the closet, my love affair over.  <br /><br />Your train trip would most probably not have lived up to your dream of it.  Better to keep the dream and not spoil it with sordid reality."
