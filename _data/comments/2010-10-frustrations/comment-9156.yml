text: "Courage!  Consider that you are getting food and shelter and time to get to be with your brother before you&#39;re both grown up and apart from each other.  (Loved your acorn shelling experience together.)  Your time is coming, and soon.  Along with the responsibility to earn your own keep, so even if you&#39;re at home and grumpy now, you&#39;re still as free as you&#39;ll ever be.  And even though I&#39;m 70, I&#39;ve been told I can&#39;t do lots of things I&#39;d like to do.  That never goes away, because we all have to live within certain limits.  Anyway, we&#39;re in your corner--patience.  Love, Grandma"
