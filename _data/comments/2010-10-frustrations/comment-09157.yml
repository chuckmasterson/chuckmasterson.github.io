text: "The bikeride will be good for you. Don&#39;t worry about the politics. One thing I have learned is the political cycle. It goes like this: Ideology, grandstanding, opposition demonization, voting, the eye of the hurricane, lobbying, payback, polling, switcherooing, gridlock, smug consensus building, endless cable news/radio blathering, back to ideology. It lasts two years. The end result is always an increase in promised entitlements to the people. <br /><br />Dave<br /><br />Dave"
