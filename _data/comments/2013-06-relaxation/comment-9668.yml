text: "I don&#39;t know how you can decide &#39;where&#39; you are going to live until you decide &#39;what&#39; you want to &#39;do&#39; with your life.<br /><br />Permaculture is mostly contradictory with the vagabond lifestyle. Globetrotting without an agenda sounds fun and exciting, but philisophically speaking, it is an exercise in narcissism.<br /><br />Sounds like what you&#39;re searching for and missing in life is permanent functional community. From what I&#39;ve read, permaculture sounds like agrarian village life. Life without the intrusions of empires, macro scale politics, and modern information age saturation. In other words, a small 19&#39;th century european or american village. It worked for centuries, even millenia. I&#39;m sure it still works in many areas of the world. <br /><br />Dave"
