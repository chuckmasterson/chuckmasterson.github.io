text: "Ah, but that&#39;s physical effort. I can handle that. It&#39;s just the mental effort that&#39;s been exhausting me lately. And even more specifically, the mental effort of planning out a completely different day every day, with no such thing as a routine, and no one else to figure out the day for me. I think I might even be able to handle a change of gears to the mental effort of babysitting, though I&#39;m sure that would start wearing me out after the same sort of amount of time.<br /><br />Enjoying life is <i>mostly</i> about attitude, but I&#39;ve taken approximately the same attitude to different places and enjoyed some of them more than others, so I think there&#39;s also something to be said for finding the right spot. I&#39;ll enjoy life wherever I end up, but I think there are some places where I&#39;d enjoy it even more than in others."
