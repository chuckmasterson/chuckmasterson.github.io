text: "An interesting Blog, of which I will comment on only one of your questions.  Where will I end up?  I will answer it of course from my perspective of having gone through this at a time of my life, not completely unlike yours, i.e., wondering what is going to happen to me.  Well that is the adventure, not knowing.  That is the fun having new items to chew on daily.  Finally, it doesn&#39;t matter, it is all attitude.  If you have the right attitude that your going to enjoy it all, you will have a fulfilled life. If your a grump about everything, it does not matter<br /> where you end up, because there is no right place.  Enjoying life, in my opinion, is all attitude."
