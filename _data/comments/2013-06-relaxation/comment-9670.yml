text: "I&#39;m fully aware that globetrotting permanently will, philosophically, get me nowhere. Which is why I&#39;m planning on setting roots. Permaculture is in some ways the opposite of what I&#39;m doing now, but in other ways I&#39;m doing useful things for it. Permaculture tries to draw on the brightest environmental ideas that people have come up with around the world, and I&#39;m gathering what I can of those while I travel around, and also communicating with people on this leading fringe of the new society. But you&#39;re right - before I can do anything that really fits under the permaculture umbrella, I have to settle down. <br /><br />Besides the agrarian part, you&#39;re not too far off with what permaculture aims for socially. Everything should be as local as possible, and the community should be the central organizational structure of life.<br /><br />Grandpa, I&#39;m in a more or less constant phase of reassessment while I&#39;m on the road - I&#39;m perpetually coming across, or up with, new ideas that I can add to myself. Sort of like in one series of <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> strips where Calvin builds a snow goon, and it comes to life, and he tries to kill it with snowballs, but they just stick to it, and it gets the idea to pack more snow onto itself, and it grows. I&#39;m that snow goon. Though if you ask me explicitly what I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s hard for me to say. I only realize what I&#39;ve learned much later sometimes, when it comes up and I realize, &quot;Yeah, I know something about that - this knowledge changed the way I think about the world.&quot;"
