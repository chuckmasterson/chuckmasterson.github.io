text: "I remember vividly the atrocities of the Khmer Rouge.  Pictures of the killing fields were in our local newspapers and magazines like Time and Newsweek.  It was an incredible sad and horrifying.period in our history, but not unprecedented.    Time however, heals some of those wounds if there is an effort to make things better, which apparently is happening.  A great blog.  A vivid picture of your travels .    G.Pa"
