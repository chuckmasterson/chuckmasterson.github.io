I agree we travel in different circles, and I also believe that it would be much harder for a 72 year old lady to stay safe if she were traveling alone and doing it the way you are doing your trip.  And, of course, that&#39;s my only perspective on the matter.  I am much in awe of how you do things.  You&#39;ve heard the old expression that youth is wasted on the young.  Well, you are proving that to be wrong.  Ha. Grandma"
