text: "Hooray and happiness, you&#39;ve gotten so far!  I am thrilled you found real Russian hospitality, and also thrilled that at some level you are using your Russian to good advantage.  I just don&#39;t have enough good adjectives to describe how I feel about what you are doing.  Love you, and will really love hearing about the Trans Siberian journey.  And Moscow, too.  Grandma"
