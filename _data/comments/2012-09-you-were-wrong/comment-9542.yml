text: "Oh Yeah!  About being wrong.  Hmmm!  You traveled in different circles than I did, so your right , I was wrong.  However it is always right to be cautious when in doubt.  <br />You have a &quot;street  knowledge&quot; that I will never have (that&#39;s what we called it back in the day), that is knowledge from personal experience.  Anyway, enjoy Poland when you get there, it is one of my favorite countries.  See you soon."
