text: "I never made it to Riga. In fact, I think I did Latvia and Lithuania a great disservice by going through both of them in one evening in a semi truck. But I&#39;m in Krakow now and having an amazing time, and strangely enough I&#39;m going to be meeting up with a fellow minimalist-freegan-hobo and hopefully learning from him while I&#39;m at such a commercial event as Oktoberfest. Catch you all soon!"
