text: "Wow, you move fast!  I certainly hope that you will get to see Auschwitz while you are in Krakow.  it is something that you will never forget.  And also, I hope you go outside that church where the trumpet player plays from the steeple to commemorate the person who was shot up there while he was playing his music.  That was really neat, too.  Looking forward to Lisbon and I&#39;m also happy you&#39;ve made it into Europe.  Happy travels.  Grandma"
