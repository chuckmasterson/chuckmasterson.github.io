Maybe in book form  Let&#39;s it&#39;s title may be &quot;One Young Man&#39;s Trip Around the World&quot;.  Anyway it is really good to hear from you.  I find it interesting that they had a computer and internet service.  Not nearly as far out in the boonies as I figured.  Have wonderful trip and see you in about three weeks.  Grandpa"
