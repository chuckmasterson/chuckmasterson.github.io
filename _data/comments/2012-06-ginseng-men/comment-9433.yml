The guys here told me it grows in Canada too, but they also implied that Korean ginseng is by far superior to anything growing in China, Japan, Canada, or the US. That lines up pretty well with what I&#39;ve witnessed of Korean nationalism. But unfortunately, factually true or not, it probably means the market for Hoosier or Canadian ginseng isn&#39;t as profitable.<br /><br />By the way, sadly, the kimchi ladies finished all their kimchi making before I got home from work."
