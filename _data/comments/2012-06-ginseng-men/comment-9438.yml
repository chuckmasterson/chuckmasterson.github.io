text: "Hm... I checked the West Virginia laws too, and Dad, I bet you weren&#39;t following all those when you were a kid. You&#39;re lucky the statute of limitations has run out on that, or who knows how much you&#39;d be fined?<br /><br />I suppose a lot of countries claim themselves as the origin of something improbable, but Korea seems to go at it with a little bit more zeal than most places. <a href=\"http://dokdoisours.blogspot.com/2009/12/explain-korea-culture-to-foreigner.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here&#39;s a blog post</a> that shows videos about Koreans claiming that bicycles, airplanes, Genghis Khan, math, the I Ching, the Aztecs, the Native Americans, and Jesus were all originally Korean. And because I doubt anyone has the patience to watch that many, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiLA6Bk_ivs\" rel=\"nofollow\">here&#39;s an ad</a> for Korean pizza, made by Koreans who are aware of how much this happens and how ridiculous it looks."
