text: "Now I have both seen it and heard it all.  Give me a break.  It sounds like the old Soviet Union after WWII when the claimed to have invented airplanes bicycles and about everything else.  If I were to take my best guess I would say that Pizza was never invented, it evolved.  That would probably get me in trouble with the antievolutionists who believe things were just created in situ; that must have also been true with the first wood fired, brick pizza oven.  I repeat: GIVE ME A BREAK."
