G.Pa  <br/><br/>P.S  Enjoy squatting over the hole for the next 50 years.  By the way use leaves not toilet paper.  In Iowa there is a plant called (Smart Weed - there really is). It is called that because you skin tingles when the leaf rubs on it.  Sooooooooo  ATTENTION:  DO NOT USE SMART WEED FOR TOILET PAPER.. <br/>PPS I hope I live long enough to see ......alkdu kliien alkdui  sdls ldkkjdfu llkd sd lkadkoleropp."
