text: "We received an e-mail from Irene today (she and the Herrings are in Alaska.  Thought you might want to know how far and wide your fame has spread.   G.Pa.<br/><br/>My turn to send a little answer -- nothing much new to report.  We had a nice late morning this morning, halibut fish and chips for brunch, and are now waiting for a \"wilderness tour\" when we will ride an old school bus up into the part to see Denali itself, if visible.  Looks like maybe there might be a chance since there are some large patches of blue sky and sunshine all over.  But the wind is vicious -- feels like December in Washington.<br/><br/>We have met up with a just graduated Grinnellian working here in the park.  She knew about the kid who wanted the barefoot rights.  She's glad to meet up with a couple of other Grinnellians, even such ancient ones, because she's not liking her job here.  We're trying to encourage her to keep looking!  She's probably going to try to stay in Alaska.  Maybe she can help out Nathanael if he comes here!<br/><br/>Oh, well, enough pie-dreaming.  Later.  Love, I.<br/><br/>So enoough of this blog.  We need a new one we can all HARP  on.  G.Pa"
