text: "The Indians did not just \"live outside\"- a teepee is not \"outside\"- it is a very well-made structure. Most people do not just \"live outside\"- every kind of group of people adapted to the environment. Scandinavian peoples and 6 Nations peoples lived in pretty snowy and woodsy places and so they developed communal longhouse living- different cultures but both seemed to figure out the best way to make use of resources and in about the same way. Similar kinds of food, too. If you look at people gropus in very different places with the same climate and resources, they come up with some of the same ideas. <br/>I don't think the people currently living are much different from those and others in the past...and present...there are more of us so we exist on a larger scale. Communication made it possible for our little commune to expand. <br/>I do not think you should live outside during the time you study at Grinnell...at least you can camp as much as you want to and maybe start the GO thing, but you're going to have to have an address.  And also there's not much so un-primitive about living in a big structure like a dorm room. Consider it a cave. No bears to contend with, even.<br/>You can learn to survive without it, and then live with it knowing you CAN survive without it if you have to.<br/>I will come over and tan the animal hides and be the grandma that watches the babies.<br/>Mom"
