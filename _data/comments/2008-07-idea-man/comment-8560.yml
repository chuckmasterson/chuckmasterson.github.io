text: "I will have to figure out how to salvage things. However, a lot of devices will become extremely irrelevant if the electricity infrastructure topples, and more if the oil infrastructure does. I do know there's more to survivalism than cooking and killing; that's why I'm going to learn how to build shelter, treat injuries and sicknesses, etc.. Hopefully, any author of an outdoor survival book will have thought of things that I haven't thought of.<br/><br/>As for my computers, well, as long as they still serve a purpose, I'll keep them around. My font skillz add up to little in terms of survivalism, but as long as people are still printing things and using computers to do it, I'll be getting in on that."
