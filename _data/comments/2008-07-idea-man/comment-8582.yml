text: "Well, I for one think your analysis is spot on. In as much as one could measure the likelyhood of something like this happening,it is measurable and I think almost inevitable, whether it takes days or years for america to collapse. We will either adapt in a radical paradigm shift, or we will cease to live as this world of \"America\" lives. Our sense of entitlement to an always improving life in america is laughable at best.<br/><br/>Dave<br/><br/>Chronological Snobbery<br/><br/>\"why-damn it- it's' medieval\"' I exclaimed, for I still had all the chronological snobbery of my period and used the names of earlier periods as terms of abuse....Barfield made short work of what I have called my \"chronological snobbery\", the un-critical acceptance of the intellectual climate common to our age and the assumption that whatever has gone out of date is on that account discredited. You must find out why it went out of date. Was it refuted(and if so by whom, where, and how conclusively) or did it merely die away as fashions do? If the latter, this tells us nothing about its truth or falsehood. From seeing this one passes to the realization that our own age is also \"a period\", and certainly has, like all periods, its own characteristic illusions. They are likeliest to lurk in those widespread assumptions which are so ingrained in the age that no one dares to attack or feels it necessary to defend them.... We had been in the technical sense of the termm \"realists\", that is, we accepted as rock-bottom reality the universe revealed by the senses... we maintained that abstract thought(if obedient to logical rules) gave indisputable truth.<br/><br/>C.S. Lewis"
