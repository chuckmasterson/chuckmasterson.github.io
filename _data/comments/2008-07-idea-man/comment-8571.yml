text: "My point in mentioning the Depression and WWI was to note that catastrophes can happen quickly, not that they're all fatal to civilization.<br/><br/>Note, however, that as we've gotten more and more civilized (and been able to have a greater impact on ourselves and the planet), our catastrophes have become correspondingly huger. A while ago, the biggest thing we had to worry about was the Irish Potato Famine. Now, we have behind us a civil war that killed hundreds of thousands, a dust bowl that saw most of the former prairies' topsoil swept away, a depression that made life a difficult proposition for a whole country, two world wars - one settled with nuclear weapons that killed seventy thousand in seconds, the narrowly avoided Cuban Missile Crisis, and September 11th. A huge catastrophe along these lines could start off a chain reaction that would encompass economic crisis, infrastructure failures, and ultimately a collapse. We think of our civilization as getting more and more sturdy as it gets bigger, but really, as more population pressure wells up on it, it becomes more and more fragile and sensitive to smaller things. Global warming has already shown its power in destroying New Orleans. Droughts and floods are showing up everywhere. Food prices are increasing at a very noticeable rate, as are oil prices. That's because both of these things are getting more scarce; peak oil is much closer than people think - in fact may be upon us. Things will just deteriorate. It won't be pretty. Now, this is all still not a certainty, and I'll never declare that anything about a potential collapse is a certainty, unless I see undeniable evidence of it. However, collapse isn't impossible. It's happened before, and it's happening currently in many places, like Africa and South America. Who knows but that Barack Obama may help the US ease into a sustainable form of society, and Asia will somehow decide it doesn't feel like rising to the First World's untenable standard of living. (The US isn't the biggest problem for the future of the world; it's China, with its aspiration to attain our standard of living. If everyone on the planet lived like Americans do, we would need three Earths to provide for us all.) I don't know what the future holds, though I'm going to be reading a lot and observing a lot to try and figure it out better. But I'm preparing for the worst. (By worst, I mean worst for civilization, and best for the rest of the planet. Extremely bad for most people, who would die in a collapse. But if civilization were to collapse later than that, it would be even worse, because more people would die. Civilization as it is is unsustainable. Its course is toward something sustainable, or toward an end.)<br/><br/>You know, I really need to read more about this so I can write with more authority behind my words. But I believe what I've written just now is pretty accurate."
