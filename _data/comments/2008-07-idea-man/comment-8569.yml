text: "A fine comment from the peanut nazi!<br/><br/>History teaches us that things often do change very quickly. Viz.: The Great Depression (it all started suddenly on October 29, 1929); the Balkan Powder Keg igniting WWI (maybe II, I don't remember exactly). It's just that things change slowly when they depend on <i>people</i> to change - which is why it's taken us this long to start working with the environment. However (if Godesky is right), civilization's collapse isn't a sudden thing. It's been in the making ever since civilization started. The roots of civiliation are the ultimate cause; peak oil or globabl warming will be the proximate cause, the hand that tips over the dominoes civilization has set up over the last thousands of years. <br/><br/>I'm not saying I have 100% certainty on this, by the way. But I do know that you just attacked straw men, whether or not Godesky's idea ultimately proves to be correct."
