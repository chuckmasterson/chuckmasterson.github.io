text: "That quote reminds me very much of the book <i>Ishmael</i>, by Daniel Quinn. Especially this part: \"[The illusions] are likeliest to lurk in those widespread assumptions which are so ingrained in the age that no one dares to attack or feels it necessary to defend them.\" I recommend the book."
