text: "Also, I would guess that you've read all of Jack London's stuff, and Robert Service.  And I read a short story when I was a kid about someone who went to the cold wilderness and forgot to pack matches, and couldn't start a fire, and froze to death.  That one really scared me.  <br/><br/>Also, when we went to High Arctic Lodge, one of the guides there, an Inuit, had lost his wife because their house had burned down at night in the winter, and without shelter she froze to death, even though he held her in his arms.  They were out too far for help to get there in time.  So surviving the wilderness isn't for wimps or fools.   Grandma"
