text: "1. In a hole.<br/>2. Anywhere. (Outside of camp.)<br/>3. N/A.<br/>4. Near the fire.<br/>5. A spit. Or dishes I pilfer from the dining hall.<br/>6. With water and leaves. They taught us that at camp.<br/>7. Infrequently. Probably at the school washing machines.<br/>8. On a clothesline.<br/><br/>9. BY GOING TO THE LIBRARY. IF I DO THIS, I'LL BE A STUDENT STILL, GOING TO CLASSES AND STUDYING. IT'S JUST THAT I'LL LIVE OUTSIDE INSTEAD OF INSIDE.<br/><br/>All except for \"GROW UP\", your post sounds pretty reasonable - questions coming from someone on the other side of this idea. As for that comment, well, in my opinion this will be an integral part of growing up. Few if any things are more manly than living off the land. And growing up is turning into a man (if you're male). Thus, learning outdoor skills is growing up. QED."
