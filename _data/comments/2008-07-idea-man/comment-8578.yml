text: "I realize, of course, that everyone made shelter. There's a section on shelter in the book I ordered. <br/><br/>I'm not against living in a dorm room specifically for the purposes of this idea I've got. Rather, the whole urban environment is the opposite of what I'd want going on. It's hard to practice primitive skills in the middle of a town - there's not a whole lot of stuff to scavenge, and what there is is in someone's yard. So, I'd have to commute to the wilderness. Seems counterproductive to me."
