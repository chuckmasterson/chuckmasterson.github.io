text: "To be a true survivalist in a post economic collapse, it would do you well to hone and develop many new skills. Learning how mechanical things work-as in cars, heaters, things that would be salvaged and used if you knew how to fix them would be good skills to have. I recommend watching \"junkyard wars\".<br/><br/>There is more to surviving than just cooking and killing. Learn all of the stuff that your uncle Dan know about building things.<br/><br/>P.S. tell Micah to stay away from the Chi Chi, unless it's salsa.<br/><br/>dave"
