text: "I'm fully aware of the risks. My biggest mental hurdle is how I'm going to live outside of a building in the Iowa winter. But, if the Indians did it, I'm confident that it's possible. They probably built shelters, and so probably I will too.<br/>I did read <i>Into the Wild</i>, and see the movie. Both were excellent, as well as touching. Alexander Supertramp's biggest mistakes was probably doing everything alone. The way things worked before civilization, foragers formed small bands of maybe a dozen or a few dozen (I'll learn more about this in anthro 101 next year, and be able to talk about it more convincingly). That way, if one had no luck hunting, he wouldn't starve, because chances are excellent that at least one of them will find something to eat every day.<br/>THe wilderness is serious stuff. I respect that, and plan to enjoy it.<br/><br/>Oh, and what are we going to do if it turns out civilization is in fine shape? Well, either live like a regular person, paying taxes and getting a 9-to-5 job and taking out a mortgage, or get sick of that and live outside despite civilization's existence. Civilization's continued existence impedes outdoor living (with hunting and fishing licenses, and hunting seasons and limits, and property laws that severely limit foraging territory), but it doesn't make it impossible."
