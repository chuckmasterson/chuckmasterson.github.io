You are all talking about things that won't happen in ANY of our lifetimes. Or our childrens childrens childrens, etc. lifetimes.<br/><br/>You are all (maybe most is better) a bunch of freaking pessimists.<br/><br/>Open your eyes and realize things just aren't that bad, no matter how bad “W” has _ucked things up.<br/><br/>You are what you eat, so stop eating nuts.<br/><br/>Dan"
