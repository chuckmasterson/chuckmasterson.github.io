text: "Okay, guys, I feel like you're all getting me wrong on this. I haven't made up my mind whether to believe this is happening or not. I see ways that it could, and ways that it couldn't. Because I see both, and not just the possibility of perpetual civilization, I'm looking like some sort of Godesky nut. I'm far from that. Though the possibility (however probable or not) of a collapsing civilization is a good motivator for me to work on outdoor skills, I would work on them whether or not this were impending as Godesky claims it is. And, despite defending his claims, I still haven't made up my mind one way or the other (because I need to read his stuff again) whether I believe Godesky. I'm defending it because it looks to me like it's a reasonably well-done argument that has the possibility of being right, and that possibility is something that would make us all pay attention pretty effectively; so, I'm defending it from the criticisms you're giving it, which are pretty shallow ones. Maybe you can give me some deeper ones, although if you want to spend your time doing that, you actually ought to read his <a href=\"http://anthropik.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thirty Theses</a>, and the criticism that other people have already given them beneath each one. Basically, the reason I'm invoking the collapse scenario in writing here is to let you know of one thing that's motivating me to learn my wilderness skills quicker, and you all can choose for yourselves whether or not you think it's a load of poppycock. I get the vibe that you're all going to say \"IT SURE IS\" instinctively. Well, maybe think about the other possibility as an actual possibility, not just some raving, before you dismiss it. Or, whatever. I don't care a whole lot at the moment."
