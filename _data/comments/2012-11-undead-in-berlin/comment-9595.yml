text: "Your stories are just unbelievable!  Keep up all the adventures.  It&#39;s not long now until you&#39;ll be home again.  I&#39;ll be interested to hear what you do in France, if anything.  If I had one place only to suggest to you to visit, it would be Normandy, Caen, and the WWII beaches.  If you could see Mt. St. Michel and St. Malo that would be great.  St. Malo is a fishing town with lots of personality and wonderful seafood restaurants.  And of course, Mt. St. Michel was another pilgrimage site with great Son et Lumiere shows.  But that&#39;s probably only in the summer.  Grandma"
