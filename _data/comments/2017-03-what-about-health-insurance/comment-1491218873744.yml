Historically, healthcare providers are average profit makers at best. 4% is the nominal number I've found. Their stock prices have soared since Obamacare, but this is purely speculative, and not indicative of massive profits. Big pharmaceutical makes an average of 20% profit so one might find some truth here. I'm tired of big pharma advertising. You can't watch wheel of fortune without the continuous onslaught of ads.\r\n\r\n- everyone I know in healthcare is happy. My wife runs a clinic for under advantaged adults with severe mental health problems. She has concerns that these poor people aren't represented, or properly advocated for in the system. They only have Medicaid, which pays next to nothing. But this isn't a healthcare problem, it's a money problem. This gets to the true heart of the issue. Healthcare is expensive. Very expensive. The politicians and constituency haven't acknowledged the elephant in the room. If everyone is going to get A-1 care, it's going to cost big. The single payer is coming, the next democrat will deliver it if Trump doesn't do it preemptively. And like everything else, it won't be properly paid for. It will go onto the list of unfunded entertainments, that stretch out into the future of insanity. As Greer has said, we are most likely on a 10-20 year timetable for a sovereign debt default. Just like Russia in 1998, the haircut is coming. \r\n\r\n- so the system is not really broken. It does very well under the massive strain it is under. \r\n\r\n- the debt burden people take on for elective education is beyond unsustainable. Just like healthcare, the system isn't broken, it's just much more expensive than we care to believe. Formal education is pricing itself out of the market in the long run. I believe most employers will continue to develop their own training, education, and development programs. It will be cheaper and more effective to screen for raw talent and do your own thing with them. Google and apple don't care if you have a degree.\r\n\r\n- my healthcare providers are happy. My primary care physician is in my marathon running group and certainly is not miserable. My urologist is middle aged, young at heart and happy. He and his wife went to a 21 pilots concert. Not the actions at a miserable person. He and his group are giving me excellent care as we watch closely for prostate cancer.\r\n\r\n- I know a nurse who works in pediatric oncology at CCHMC. She watches kids die from cancer. When Kim worked at CCHMC, she regularly talked with the oncologists, they work very closely with the orthopedic surgeons. One of them told her he worked there several YEARS before he had a patient who actually survived. Kids who get cancer die. She does it because she is called to it. She has attended many funerals. Is she miserable? Perhaps she is much of the time, but she still does it, and thank God she does."
