text: "I'm speaking from a lot from what I've heard from people who are involved with the medical industry, Dave. Some of what I argue is based on thought experiments, but this one happens to be based fairly substantially on real-world experience.\r\n\r\nOne person I know who's training to be a doctor tells us the on-the-job training makes him pretty miserable most of the time. Another doctor in training I've met has intense moral ambivalence about everything she's doing, and wishes the field were very different. I know a few people who've started getting into the medical field, as nurses or in similar work, and had to get out because they couldn't stand it for quite a few reasons, like disagreeing with the industry's direction or realizing how overworked they would always be (reasons that are consistent from person to person, not just each person's individual excuses or whines). \r\n\r\nEveryone I know who's getting into healthcare is deeply alarmed by the amount of debt they've taken on, and one has told me she's seriously looked at which countries she could move to that don't extradite for debt. The nurses in Minneapolis were on strike for quite a while late last year because their benefits were being slashed.\r\n\r\nA lot of my friends have chronic health problems, and all of them talk about the difficulty of finding doctors who will really listen and care. Most of them have found some, but it took them a lot of looking and advocating for themselves. There's no doubt in my mind that someone without the time or energy (or acculturation) to do that advocating would have an even harder time finding good care.\r\n\r\nWhat are you basing your alternative view on?"
