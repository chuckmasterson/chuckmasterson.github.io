text: "Now comes a complete blank check bailout of Wall street via the federal government. If this doesn't smell like 1929 I don't know what does. Everyone pay attention in the next election. How can anyone possibly propose tax cuts in an enviornment like this. Everyone who reads this blog is now in charge of bailing out his/her retirement or 401k. Most of america will just whine for a tax cut and push it onto their kids and grand-kids. This is like a huge bill that nobody will pay. Then, the grand patriarch comes in and with bellicose cocksure, grabs the check and saunters off. Except the grand patriarch doesn't have a pot to piss in, puts it on his 39'th visa card and gives the mailing address for the bill to YOUR kids.<br/><br/>The congressional bailout will likely top 2 trillion dollars and that is just for starters. Now THAT is some deficit spending.<br/><br/>Dave"
