text: "I think this looks like Rome burning in a nutshell, but I've been branded a pessimist for saying so.<br/><br/>It's all Conservative fun and games until the shit hits the fan and then it's time to put on the socailism hat while the top 1/4 of 1% goes off and licks it's wounds. It's ok though, we can just continue to cut taxes and \"grow our way out\" of this mess.<br/><br/>The federal reserve and the national treasury just got bent over to the tune of 85 Billion, and since they(republicans) claim to pay all of the taxes anyway, of course they will accept all of the blame, right? Just keep cutting taxes, because I ain't gonna pay no more taxes!!! Y'all are stealin' my money.<br/><br/>Next we may hear from rapid inflation, and currency devaluation. Everyone will be in bail me out line. Ford, GM, Chrysler, Wall Street, Airlines, etc.......welcome to the nanny state.<br/><br/>Sound like south american politics? Who the hell do we think we are? Venezuala?<br/><br/>Watch for the coup de etat.... the surge worked right?<br/><br/>Dave"
