text: "The debt and future obligations we are piling up will never get paid. The only real solution is that things like social security and medicaid will just become insolvent on the mainstreet level, and they will just cease to exist.<br/><br/>Greener pastures will begin to lure away much of the talent in america. A brain drain will ensue, as it did in Colombia.<br/><br/>Rich world will continue to make it wherever it may migrate.<br/><br/>You might enjoy reading the economist. It's the closest thing I have found to truly fair and balanced journalism. They don't sugarcoat it, or color it red or blue. It's written from a real global perspective and always follows the money trail. Look for the money and the politics will follow.<br/><br/>I've already seen estimates for over a trillion on the bailout. Two trillion equals 15% of GDP. That's just the congressional front end IOU's. I hope it works, if the world doesn't believe we can pull it off, the whole globe is gonna see 1929!<br/><br/>You are right about oil too. Most people in the US don't realize that if we drilled for and recovered all of the oil that we think is out there, we still will NEVER approach the level of domestic production when it peaked in the US. This is all by the oil industries own omission. Domestic drilling is a long, costly, and in the enditis a very small band-aid to a problem that has already outpaced such a frivilous solution.<br/><br/>But, hey that isn't what voters want. Drill here, cut my taxes, and turn on TMZ baby!!!<br/><br/>Dave<br/><br/>Dave"
