text: "I wouldn&#39;t worry about the new kid on the block. He went to school in Switzerland and was a huge Michael Jordan fan. If there is anything to worry about it would be a power struggle, as I am sure this kid doesn&#39;t have a clue. Anywho, you&#39;re at the mercy of an information chaing that releases little or no information. If there is anything to worry about, by the time you start worrying, &quot;it&quot; will have already happened.<br /><br />Dave"
