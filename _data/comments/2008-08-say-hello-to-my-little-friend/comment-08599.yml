text: "Most snake keepers just leave the temperature the same year-'round. If they want the snake to breed they might lower it a little and then raise it again, but otherwise they don't really need to hibernate, and it's tricky.<br/><br/>A husky would produce in one day more than this pet's weight in poop. This was one factor figuring prominently into why I wanted a snake, especially for college."
