text: "Welcome home!  Glad to hear you got here safe and sound.  Now, how about coming up here this Sunday for dinner (barbecued ribs) to celebrate a summer job well done, and a month of relative leisure for you.  We also have a little something for you from Russia. <br/><br/>Ask Mom and Dad if they're coming.  I already mentioned it to your mother and she said OK.  Remind her.  Talk to you soon.  Grandma"
