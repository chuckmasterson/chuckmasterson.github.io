text: "Thanks, Aunt Ellen---and sorry to hear you've gotten stranded in an in-between state. If I remember right, you were at least moving to Colorado, so now that you're there, you can visit your family? (At least from 6 feet away or so.) Misty works in an assisted living facility now, and tells me about the loneliness of lockdown there. We both feel for you there. (Misty wonders if you get as much fun out of watching caretakers there as Misty's own residents do from watching them.)\r\n\r\nI'm happy to know that the paths I'm following now are the paths that someone older and wiser than me figured I'd eventually take, having watched me grow up. \r\n\r\nLove back to you from Misty and me both."
