text: "So glad to hear of your progress in life and your decision to permanently share it with another human being.  I'm sorry I've never been able to meet Misty in person.  Congratulations on your engagement!  \r\n\r\nWe are stranded in a messy apartment in a retirement facility.  We moved into this independent living arrangement on March 1st, just as covid-19 hit the country in full force, and we don't know what has happened to many of our possessions.  I do, fortunately have in this room 8 or 9 copies of each of the books you published for me.  They are definitely my legacy to the family.  \r\n\r\nI also want to encourage you to follow your writing career.  Publishing a magazine sounds like something you can successfully accomplish.  And teaching is also a route we always expected you to take.  Don't be too concerned about finding your \"home\".  When you get there, you will know it.\r\n\r\nSending love to you both."
