I told her about you and Tara Banks and how the 3 of us went to prom together. She couldn’t believe people go to prom without an official date.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I remembered you had a blog and decided to look it up and show her! I’m so glad I did! Life sounds beautiful and I couldn’t be happier for you. \r\n\r\nCongratulations on the engagement!"
