I still remember a bunch of the times we hung out, like that bowling alley birthday party I had.\r\n\r\nAs for prom, I guess I always was one to go against the grain a little, but then of course the other half of the equation is that I was pretty oblivious to most social cues, as I'm sure you remember. I had a lot of fun, though. If your daughter's already starting to think about prom at age 9, maybe my story of not thinking about it until, like, two weeks beforehand (if that) can get her mind off it for a few years.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nP.S. Didn't we go with Amanda Schrenk too?"
