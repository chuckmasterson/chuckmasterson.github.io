  Finally I have time to read your blog again. Congratulations!! I see you guys
  are developing souls together frm the very beginning. I read many stories
  including Misty and  the last was the story of how you and misty got names in
  Ojibwee. What an inspiring journey~ I am planning to send a letter (covid 19
  made me postponed to send the letters earlier). I will email you to get the
  updated address. Stay healthy and happy for both of you :) Sending my warmest
  hug from Indonesia
