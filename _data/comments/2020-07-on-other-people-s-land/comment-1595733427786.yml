  Thanks! Good to hear from you---I was just starting to wonder if my last
  letter ever reached you. I guess you're back from Borneo by now. No need to
  hurry writing back, but I'll certainly be glad to see your next letter
  whenever it shows up. I suppose it would be a little too difficult to try to
  invite you to the wedding, though.... (My mom got invited to a friend's
  wedding in Sri Lanka a couple years ago, but he was marrying the daughter of a
  fantastically rich couple.)
