text: "Let me put my two cents worth in.  You make some great points about staying put in Grinnell, but take it from one who shoulda and coulda but didn't do it.  I have regretted that decision all my life.  Getting out of your comfort zone is what it's all about, and I guarantee it will change your perspective about a lot of things.  And give you a confidence you can't get any other way.  Grandma"
