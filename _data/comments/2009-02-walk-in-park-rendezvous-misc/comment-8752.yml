text: "I too was loath to leave Grinnell for any of that all-too-short time there, and back then it was not so common a thing to go off, not at all.  But I have discovered since that missing a semester would not have made much difference to my Grinnell career, but might have made an enormous difference to my world understanding.  <br/><br/>I did go abroad the summer between my junior and senior years, for a six-week homestay in Puno, Peru, plus travel to La Paz and Cuzco, Arequipa and Lima.  It opened up my life enormously, and was probably the smartest thing I ever did. <br/><br/>I'll send you the essay I wrote about it after your grandparents and I went to Peru in 2005.<br/><br/>Love, Irene"
