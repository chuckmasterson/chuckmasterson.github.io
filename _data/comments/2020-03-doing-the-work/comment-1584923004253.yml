text: "I thought about that during the process of writing this. The conclusion I came to is that the journey I wrote about is still in its early phases, and I want to wait until it's taken a more definite shape before I think about trying to do such a thing as publish it. These hundred pages might turn into a foundation to build a book around, if I think a book on this would be useful.\r\n\r\nI also want to keep in mind something I read in Kent Nerburn's *Neither Wolf nor Dog*: a Lakota elder told him something like, \"If a white person stays on the rez for a month, they think they can write a dissertation. If they're here for a day, they want to write a booklet. If they stop at the gas station they write a newspaper article.\" (In the movie version apparently it went, \"If I had a nickel for every time a white guy came out here to write a book about us, I could buy back the Black Hills.\")\r\n\r\nWhich is to say, I only want to write a book if I'm saying something that helps people, not just to put a notch in my belt or get some royalty checks rolling in. The same elder told Nerburn to write that book, so it is a bar that's possible to clear."
