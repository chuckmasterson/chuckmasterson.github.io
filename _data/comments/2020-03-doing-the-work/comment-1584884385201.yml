text: "Such an excellent story! Bravo!\r\n\r\nYour story is different but similar to mine. I grew up in a dead church, or so I thought. Perhaps I was just too young to get anything spiritual that may have been going on. But I did sense, the deadness, fakery , not quite sure what it all was, I just knew I didn’t like it.\r\n\r\nFast forward a couple decades and I stumbled into Christianity in a way I never knew possible. Everything was real and authentic. It lead me to CS Lewis, Chesterton, George MacDonald, Augustine,and many more. Nothing felt so liberating as to throw off the cloak of scientific materialism that insists nothing spiritual exists. What a shitty burden it is to carry that torch of fallacy. I always found it odd that our family makes great sport of chasing down ancestry, DNA and the like, but we have no curiosity to our spiritual roots. I am descendent of Christians, Christian Science, Mennonites, and many more whose stories are lost. Nobody seems to care. A spiritual vacuum without a whit of spiritual curiosity. My grandmother had something special. Different. She had the Holy Spirit inside of her. I could see it plain as day before I knew what it was. A marginally educated woman who dabbled in a religion that mixed Christianity with magic. It was real. I KNOW it. Yet all of the family talk centered around the intellectuals, the degrees, the money, the material accomplishments.\r\n\r\nI believe you’re on the right path. A path almost all of our ancestors deserted. A rich path full of so much of what’s missing in modern life."
