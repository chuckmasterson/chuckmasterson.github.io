text: "Sorry your nemesis seems to be the French language.  I agree it&#39;s a bear to spell, but you&#39;ve got to admit the language is beautiful.  Can&#39;t believe someone would be able to spell uintjie.  That&#39;s crazy.  Anyway, it sounds like you had a lot of fun and learned to appreciate how hard it is to spell EVERYTHING right.  We&#39;re proud of you.  Grandma"
