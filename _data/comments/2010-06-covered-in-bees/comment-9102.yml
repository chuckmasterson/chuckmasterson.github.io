I think your best strategy is to invent some words, get them in the dictionary, and then someday, you&#39;ll know the obscure words that nobody else does.<br /><br />It&#39;s nice you are in a place that does such things, I&#39;ve never heard of it being done in the Nati area.<br /><br />Your German DNA must prevent you from spelling those French words. If it were the other way around, you would have quit the spelling be once you heard the difficult German word.<br /><br />Dave"
