text: "I&#39;ll get in touch with you dreckly, Dad. As for shoes... the last time I had a pair of Merrells, I&#39;m pretty sure they were 12s, and they fit just fine. The specific model was the Jungle Moc, which seems like it might be their most popular. I could measure my feet in actual inches, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d be able to do it well enough to get a useful number without one of those foot measurers that they have at shoe stores."
