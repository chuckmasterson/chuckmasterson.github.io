text: "Could you explain who those musicians are--I don't know your peculiar OR your less oddball ones, but then as an official old lady I am forgiven, I hope.  Just wondering-where do you keep your car at school?  Is there a special parking lot, as at Miami, or must you park on the street wherever you can find a spot?  And do you need to have a special sticker?  Just wondering.  Glad you are safely there and hard at work again, and enjoy the couch.  That's just perfect.  Grandma"
