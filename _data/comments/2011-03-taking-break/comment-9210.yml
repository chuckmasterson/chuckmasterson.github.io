And enjoy it, because it will seem like a nanosecond and you really will be a fogey.<br /><br />Just so the fogey has done something interesting with his life, and I have no doubt you will.  <br /><br />Sorry you won&#39;t be home for break, but we understand.<br />We&#39;re making plans to come to Grinnell for your graduation.  Tell us more about it if you can.  Grandma"
