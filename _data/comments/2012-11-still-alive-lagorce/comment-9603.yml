I was on Facebook getting ready to start chatting, but then one of the other two volunteers here got a Skype call and I had to vacate the computer while she explained to her family that Paris is a pit and when they come to visit her they should get away from it as quick as possible. I disbelieve her. Anyhow, we&#39;ll chat sometime soon, probably!"
