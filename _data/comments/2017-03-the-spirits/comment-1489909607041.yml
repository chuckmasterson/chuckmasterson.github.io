  It's one of my highest hopes to find that I've stumbled upon an old problem
  that was important enough to engage the minds of people as bright as C.S.
  Lewis. I listened to that essay of his, and a lot of it sounded familiar from
  what I've been reading and what I've been thinking. In particular *Zen and the
  Art of Motorcycle Maintenance* treads a lot of the same ground (including the
  Tao) but with undertones of hippie.
