text: "That's interesting---the Ojibwe have a very similar practice. It's a four-day fast, and it normally happens on a lake island rather than a mountain. And people often come back with stories of the spirits.\r\n\r\nA story that I left out of this series (because it was already so long) was one I was told about a council that was convened a few decades ago. Leaders from indigenous cultures around the whole world met, and they had a sort of council to try to figure out the world's current situation. While they were laying the groundwork by finding their points of commonality, they found that they all had similar prophecies---of an end, fairly soon, of the current way of life, and a cycling back to something different. They also apparently agreed on most aspects of the proper way to live with the Earth.\r\n\r\nAs for spirits in trees, you might be interested to know that Ojibwe nouns have a distinction between *animate* (living, sentient creatures) and *inanimate* (things). Trees (and stones too!) are animate nouns."
