text: "I am in awe of what you are doing.  I never expected that you&#39;d get to N. Korea!  Those pictures are unbelievable, and I&#39;m glad you are out of there and safe.  I guess what you did shows that wherever someone can, he&#39;ll make a tourist buck.  And it was worth it, I&#39;m sure, just for the bragging rights.  I know I sure bragged you up at my bridge club last night.  None of them has a grandkid or anyone else who&#39;s been to North Korea.  You are truly one in a million.  Keep it up!  Grandma"
