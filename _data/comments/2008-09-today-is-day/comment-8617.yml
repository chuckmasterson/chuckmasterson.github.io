text: "He'll get to be somewhere between 4 and 6 feet. I think the males are usually smaller, and he's one of those, so he'll probably top out around 5 feet... but that's an extremely speculative number. Not sure how much he'll weigh at that point. Maybe like ten or fifteen pounds. Probably closer to ten. This is also a guess. He's a constrictor (it's illegal to keep venomous snakes without a permit, and I think it's pretty much just zoos that get those). It takes him two or three minutes to swallow a mousesicle, and then a little while longer to get it about to the middle of his length. He's sorta playful, but still shy. He'll be more fun to play with once he gets bigger and I don't have to worry about him disappearing into a cranny somewhere if he gets out of my hands."
