text: "Well Nate, you certainly grew up nicely over the last 4 years. You have gained immense perspective and introspective. I especially like the way you seam to readily acknowledge that you still have more to learn about life and your future life path. You&#39;re gonna be fine, barefoot and big hair or not.<br /><br />BTW, you were a good help to us too. Tracy and I appreciated your help. Sorry Beth was a bit distant with you. Honestly, a few people probably talked you up a bit too much to her ahead of meeting you and that probably turned her off.  Part of her thing is also that she is the smartest person in her family, and one of the only (maybe the only one ever) ones to go to college, whereas you grew up in a family (at least on my side) where every single member  has a college degree.<br /><br />I had dinner with Micah last night, and unfortunately he is still spectacularly immature and angry. I fear for his future. You are exactly spot on with your comments to your mom. It&#39;s this simple: Idle hands are the devils playthings. If he doesn&#39;t get his act together quick, I&#39;m absolutely positive he will soon be hopelessly addicted to one of these three drugs: Meth, Heroin or Oxycontin. For each of those it only takes one try and they are all EVERYWHERE. Once that happens he&#39;ll be lying, stealing and betraying anyone and everyone like never before to feed the beast that is the drug. That is my prediction, albeit gruesome. <br /><br />Man, that felt pretty shitty that I had to just write that about a family member. Shitty indeed."
