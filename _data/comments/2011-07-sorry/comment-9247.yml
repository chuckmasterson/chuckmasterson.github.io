That should  help him in a work environment.  I&#39;ve also seen him work very hard, and he really helped moving Ann&#39;s furniture from the auction site.  I am not going to count him out! <br /><br />We leave tomorrow for Europe.  I&#39;m ready.  Too much heat here, and it&#39;s been cold and rainy there.  It&#39;s weird when cold and rainy sounds good for a change.  Gma"
