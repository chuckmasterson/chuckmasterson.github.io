text: "I remain the eternal optimist.  Doom and gloom is something I will not consider until it actually happens.  A good job, and the right boss and Micah will be fine.  in a year or two I think he will consider some more education.  As for you, I am impressed by the choice of your Location in Korea.  I believe you will have many great stories to tell over the next few yars.  I hope you blog many of them while you are there.  Maybe, Grandma and I will come and visit.   GRANDPA"
