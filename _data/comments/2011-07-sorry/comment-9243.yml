text: "Great posting, Nathanael.  You SO have it together.  And even though you didn&#39;t think you were helping us that much, we couldn&#39;t have had Crow Duck without you this year.  Thanks again for being there, and sorry you didn&#39;t catch a monster fish.<br /><br />We will be back from Europe on Aug. 12.  I would like to see you before you leave, so let&#39;s plan something here.  Also, is there anything you&#39;d like us to think of buying for you in Germany or Czech Republic (Prague)?"
