text: "Go for that Japanese!  It will be much more useful than a European language, I&#39;d venture to say, because it&#39;s much more difficult for an English speaker to learn well.  But I know you can do it, if anyone can.  And then to go abroad to Japan is the icing on the cake.  I&#39;ll bet your mom is encouraging it, too.  She loves Japan.  In other news, Grandpa had an episode in the hospital last week, but is recovering and doing pretty well at home now.  It did, however, cause us to miss out on our Egypt trip.  We&#39;ll probably reschedule later.  Take care.  Grandma"
