text: "I would like to remind you that for Canada this year you will need a passport.  You can get a passport card (cheaper) but it doesn't allow you to go to Europe or other destinations.  I suggest a regular passport because you will be traveling internationally in the near future.  It will take 4 - 6 weeks for the passport, so do not procrastinate.  That would be a good way to spend some of your font royalty.  Grandma"
