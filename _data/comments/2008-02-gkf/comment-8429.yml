text: "How enlightening. Be sure to keep that from your brother. Right now I'm in a war against the Insane Clown Posse. They raise the collective conscience of humanity by their illuminating anthem, \"Bugz on my BallSack\". Every other thing they sing about is equally worthy of contemplation. Details aren't necessary but they follow along your illustrious Li'l Wayne's lines. My weapon of choice in this war consists not of shockage but insane, contemptuous laughter. You're not alone. Sir Isaac Newton, as a student, was disillusioned with most of his classmates at Cambridge who were only concerned with drinking and carousing while he was more concerned with proving objects fall to the ground due to something later called gravity, and not because they longed to returned to the earth. I'm sure the ditties of his day were equally enlightening. Poor Newton checked out of society and became a recluse. But you stick with your militant krokay front and you may find a bit of solace.<br/><br/>In all sincerity, I LOVE YOU and we, with the help of the scholarships, are paying out the wazoo for a decent place for you to live, and perhaps if it gets really bad you can go to your RA to discuss how Jay and Jeremy are torturing you with this stuff to the point that you can't do anything else. It seems they like to torture each other but now it's gotten rather ridiculous. Dis shiznit's gotta stop, dawg."
