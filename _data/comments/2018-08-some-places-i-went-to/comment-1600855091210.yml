I was interested to find out how \r\nyou center yourself and clear your thoughts before writing.\r\nI've had trouble clearing my thoughts in getting my thoughts out.\r\n\r\nI do enjoy writing however it just seems like the first 10 to 15 minutes are lost just trying to figure \r\nout how to begin. Any recommendations or hints? Kudos!\r\n\r\n\r\nLook into my blog post :: [суспільства на демократичних засадах?](https://histua.com/istoriya-ukraini/novitnij-chas/progoloshennya-stvorennya-unr-3-universal \"суспільства на демократичних засадах?\")"
