text: "Glad you like them. I heard Micah&#39;s steadily reading my blog and working his way to the present day, so I suppose he&#39;ll find these soon. Micah, hope you can tessellate some key parts of your world with these.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I forgot to reply about when I can meet you in Spain. I have some figuring to do before I can actually answer that question. I was planning to do Germany until early or mid October, then go to England. I suppose what I&#39;ll end up doing is moving Spain to after Germany. I just have to figure out when I can meet up with my English parkour contact. I&#39;ll have to make a schedule of some sort, but I think I may end up having to meet during the later, more inconvenient end of your trip. I&#39;ll let you know when I know more."
