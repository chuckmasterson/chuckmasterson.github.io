text: "If you could get to southern Spain by Oct. 16 (a night before, actually) and we could figure out how it&#39;s done, you could go across to Tangier in Morocco for the day the way we are doing.  I figure our group must have it organized by public ferry or other boat.  We could check into it.  I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t mind adding the continent of Africa to your world wanderings, even if only for a day.  If not that, then it would be nice to see Lisbon together.  I&#39;ve already been there, so I could skip the formal tour with the group.  It is a fun place to be.  Grandma"
