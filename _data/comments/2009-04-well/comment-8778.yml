text: "I'm not worried about you. College students are supposed to be broke and perhaps riddled with debt. A comfortable life that spoils you with no hard choices will always lead to minimal growth. Your ancestors who lived through the 1930's, with sheer determination, cunning, and without the luxury of global savvy and education, made it just fine. As a parent you always crave safety, security, and a predictable life. Most of the time it is a counter-intuitive trap, because this is not how life works. I think we are all getting a macro-economic lesson in that right now. Even if the whole country falls to martial law and total economic collapse, you still won the world lottery. The world's truly poor would love to be \"american poor\".<br /><br />Final advice..... Ramen noodles.... lots of Ramen noodles!<br /><br />Dave"
