text: "Gee, I was thinking of inviting you to come along with us next year but I see now that would be a waste of time and good weather.  I mean 77 to 86   would go unwanted.  Thus  Grandma and I will go again somewhere, next year, alone.  I was thinking Fiji, a place you obviously would not like.  However, next time I go to the  Arctic in January, I will give you a call.  Don&#39;t wait up for it,  All is well here.  - 20 last night in Hamilton.  More snow predicted tonight and tomorrow.  We will survive.  Grampa"
