text: "Hahahaha.  Those Hawaiians aren&#39;t real Amurricans?  Or Floridians?  Or Puerto Ricans?  Maybe it should be that we need to tough it out like Minnesotans.  Ha.  Or former Iowans.  Really, it was nice to get away to the tropics, but in truth, I love the cold weather and beautiful snow.  It&#39;s refreshing.  I wouldn&#39;t want to live in a climate that doesn&#39;t have a real winter, that&#39;s for sure.<br /><br />After all, what&#39;s a good homemade pot of soup good for in the middle of hot weather?"
