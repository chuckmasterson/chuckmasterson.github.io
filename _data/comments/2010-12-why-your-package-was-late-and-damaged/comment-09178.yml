Also about the work world and no time for anything else and why the heck would people spend their lives working...<br /><br />The poor planning was evidenced by your statement &quot;This means that, of my Semester of Adventure, about seven days of a potential 145 were actually spent adventuring&quot;. And most of the reasons you give for not adventuring like you want were due to other people or unforeseen circumstances in which no contingency was in place. <br /><br />I know that your plans for this past semester were loosely planned, but if the next 2.5 years go the same way, by my math you will have spent 44 days out of 912 doing what you loosely planned, 63 days if you count hunting.<br /><br />What I&#39;m saying is loose plans can also contain lots of backup plans and contingencies.  Loose plans could also be a cover for poor planning, or not really planning at all.<br /><br />As for the rainbow gathering: I&#39;ve been around enough stink-laden hippies to know that they pretty much all do drugs all the time, even if they are just wake and bake pot heads. here&#39;s a good example:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI<br /><br />As for Hippocrates... well Damnit my original misspelling was so bad spell check came up with that and I&#39;m such an inept speller I didn&#39;t notice."
