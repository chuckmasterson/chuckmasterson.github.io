text: "Sounds to me like you are grumping about everyone else because you haven&#39;t been able to accomplish your own goals. Quit whining and making excuses for why you aren&#39;t getting things done. Get off your ass and get organized. When you fly by the seat of your pants, you don&#39;t even get off the ground. There, I said it, someone needed to.<br /><br />And, let me tell you what you&#39;ll learn at the Rainbow gathering... there will be plenty of money all being exchanged for drugs.  Yeah even the hippies don&#39;t give away their drugs. That outta ruin your view of those scalawags. Your uncle Joe went to that crap back in the day and brought a few hippies back with him looking to freeload, when I gave them the boot they were none to pleased and their loving demeanor became meaner. Hippocrates.<br /><br />Damn, I was harsh. Have a few grains of salt and you&#39;ll feel better."
