text: "Wait, let&#39;s take this point by point, because I&#39;m puzzled.<br />•When was I grumping about everyone else?<br />•I have my life planned out for the next 2½ years. Even if a year of that is intentionally loosely planned, I still think having the next 2½ years planned out counts as being organized.<br />•At Rainbow Gatherings, hard drugs and alcohol are forbidden, inasmuch as it&#39;s possible to forbid something without violently enforcing the forbidding. Of course, there will be people who disregard that, but from all I&#39;ve heard, the guidelines are normally stuck to. Those who want to drink even have a section of the gathering for themselves, miles away from the rest. It&#39;s more organized than you&#39;d think, with a bunch of hippies. They&#39;ve had since 1972 to figure out a good system.<br />•You&#39;re correct that some hippies freeload. So do some non-hippies. <br />•You mean &quot;hypocrites&quot;. Hippocrates is the guy who created the Hippocratic Oath."
