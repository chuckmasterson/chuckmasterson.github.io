text: "Alfi - the last few books I&#39;ve read have been seriously advanced English. Right now I&#39;m working on Vladimir Nabokov&#39;s <i>Pale Fire</i>, and he&#39;s using dozens of words I&#39;ve never seen. Same with Annie Dillard&#39;s <i>Living by Fiction</i>. But for an author who influenced my own writing style when I was a kid, try Bill Bryson. The first book by him that I read was <i>The Lost Continent</i>, and it&#39;s great. You&#39;ll also learn a lot about America (circa 1987). Another book like that one, which I just read, is <i>Blue Highways</i>, by William Least Heat-Moon. That one will also give you a good idea of what some of the different American accents sound like. Bryson&#39;s <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is also great. Some of Bill Bryson&#39;s humor comes from the way he uses formal English to describe everyday stuff, so look out for that. And for something a little easier, it may be hard to find in Indonesia, but I can&#39;t highly enough recommend the young-adult books of Daniel Pink water. <i>5 Novels</i> is a good collection to look for. Those ought to get you started at least.<br /><br />Dave - what sort of tromping around are we talking about? The kind where you wish you&#39;d kept that backpack after all? It&#39;s still at my mom&#39;s house if you need it... in any case I&#39;m looking forward to hearing about your adventures. About time someone besides me and Grandma and Grandpa got to go on one, and Lord knows you deserve a break."
