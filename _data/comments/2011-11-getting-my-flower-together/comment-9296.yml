text: "Actually I don&#39;t think I will be home in time for the elections, though it&#39;s possible. My plan is that I&#39;ll be traveling starting when I finish my contract in late August 2012 and continuing into that December. Then I&#39;ll get home in time for Christmas 2012. <br /><br />As for Christmas 2011, I don&#39;t really know. You can keep the Christmas money on reserve until 2012, since I won&#39;t be in any urgent need of it. As for gifts, hmm... <br /><br />I was planning it out that we&#39;d do a video chat on Christmas Day, and I&#39;d watch you all open your presents, and talk, and stuff like that. So, we could do that two ways as regards sending gifts. <br /><br />1) You could keep my gifts under the tree and someone could open them for me. Then I&#39;d tell you which ones I really wanted to have sent to me, and you could send them. (Or possibly, I&#39;d decide I could wait to have those things until getting back, and you wouldn&#39;t have to pay any postage at all... though chances are I&#39;ll be hankering for at least some Christmas cookies.) <br /><br />2) You could send me some or all of my presents, and then while you all open your presents, I&#39;d open mine and show them off over the video chat. <br /><br />I suppose it&#39;s really up to you... the first one may be simpler. If I&#39;m sent big things I&#39;ll probably end up sending them home again anyhow in my big lightening-my-load package(s) that I&#39;ll send home before I start traveling. <br /><br />I&#39;m planning to send a few little gifts your way, too, though I&#39;ve only decided for sure on one of them."
