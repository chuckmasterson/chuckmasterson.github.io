text: "Good that you&#39;ve figured out you&#39;re not going to change your co-teacher.  Trying to change another person is a huge effort in futility.  I had lots of horrible principals and I tried to avoid them when possible, and always tried to avoid a direct confrontation, because I was sure to lose, even if I was right.  That&#39;s school politics.  And the reality of who has the power.<br /><br />Don&#39;t be sorry you&#39;re not here for those demonstrations.  I think the country will still have plenty of problems to fight after you get back.  Ha.  Enjoy your time abroad, it&#39;s the best thing you could be doing for yourself right now.  And I love that you are writing, too.  I hope that someday I&#39;ll see a book of yours published.  Keep it up.  Grandma"
