text: "I agree with almost all of your post. The irony in these candidates is deep. In 1992, Bill Clinton ran a campaign of &quot;change&quot; vs. George HW Bush&#39; &quot;more of the same&quot;. Now Hillary represents &quot;more of the same&quot;. People are afraid of Donald Trumps misogyny and institutional sexual perversion, yet Bill Clinton himself proved the office capable of withstanding it. Hillary Clinton has had the largest stage available, a bully pulpit if you will, to materially manifest to all other women how to walk away from a serial sex addict. Instead we get Stockholm syndrome &quot;cooperate and graduate&quot;. Her political navigation is a meandering middling mess. She reminds me of Richard Nixon, covert, secretive, ambiguous and cagey.<br /><br />Then of course you have Trump. Trump is a brand, not a politician. He proves Kim Kardashian could easily win the presidency, and it wouldn&#39;t surprise me if she did. He is intensely narcissistic and clearly incapable of listening to anyone, especially his own advisors. Ironically what to &quot;plastic man&quot; Mitt Romney down is what could have ensured him the presidency. All he had to do was run a canned, rehearsed, regurgitated campaign in a monotone generic non threatening posture. Yet he could not do it.<br /><br />Whichever brand wins, the lobbyists will win in the end. The money will be heard one way or another. I give both candidates less than a 50% chance of completing four years before being impeached. It will be middling politics as usual. The number one thing I see on the horizon is the healthcare bubble bursting. This will be the next &quot;big thing&quot;. Invariably a grand bargain will be struck ensuring basic healthcare for all, and the bill will be stapled onto the 20 trillion dollar debt that won&#39;t ever go away. And the liberals will chant &quot;take it from the rich&quot;, and the conservatives will chant &quot; lower the taxes&quot; and life will go on, largely the same. It really is good at the top. We complain, but to the outside world we look like the 1000 princes of Saudi Arabia fighting about how to divide the spoils. We ARE the 1%&#39;ers every single person reading this blog is a global 1%&#39;er.<br /><br /><br />"
