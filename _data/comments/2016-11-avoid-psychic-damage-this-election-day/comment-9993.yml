text: "Excellently laid out. I always like hearing from people who were actually around during more than a few previous administrations and can really compare them.<br /><br />I&#39;m not sure I believe Trump would have gotten this far if he had run a &quot;canned, rehearsed, regurgitated campaign&quot;, though. I think almost all of what gets him his appeal is that he makes himself look like a loose cannon, and people are desperate for a loose cannon to make the Washington establishment do something different. <br /><br />I&#39;m very curious to see what comes out the other end of this incredible, criminal, predatory healthcare fiasco. If I&#39;d been around forty years ago and you&#39;d asked me to make a bet on how bad the money-grubbing and general awfulness could get, I think even in my most pessimistic moods I would&#39;ve guessed it would collapse before this point. It&#39;s like something out of <i>The Trial</i>.<br />"
