text: "Well perhaps it takes a woman to understand why Hillary might want to play it more privately than a man might want to.  And perhaps it takes a gray-head reading the diaries of a man who watched and reported first-hand on the rise of Hitler, to understand how closely Trump&#39;s narcissism resembles that other&#39;s self-absorption, and to easily grow a fear of having the same thing happen again. And just maybe it takes a gray-haired woman who has been living in a man&#39;s world much of her life to understand what it means when a political party that was eager to impeach the other party&#39;s man for consentual sexual exploits is now ready to elect their own man to the same office although he has done even worse things. But never mind.  An old gray-haired lady can also understand when people she cares about take the time to try to assuage the fears of the frantic.  I can&#39;t agree with everything you say -- I&#39;ve been around too long not to know how truly horrid people can be to one another -- but I&#39;m awfully glad those nearest to me are trying to make things better. from your old Auntie I."
