text: "Yes Trump got where he is by being the contrarian candidate. But unlike all good....er um I mean proficient politicians, he never moved to the middle and dummied up once he won the nomination. Once he won his contrarian campaign, he easily would have picked up a few percent if he had just stayed on a canned message and campaign. Instead he blew up the world with 1000 tweets of ambiguous insanity.<br /><br />It&#39;s kind of poetic justice. In many ways America is on a race to the bottom, and of course we have candidates that are a perfect reflection of America&#39;s dismal political state. When your average constituent imbibes two decades of FOX, CNN, MSNBC, Rush Limbaugh, and a constant IV drip of PC sterilization, what would one honestly expect?"
