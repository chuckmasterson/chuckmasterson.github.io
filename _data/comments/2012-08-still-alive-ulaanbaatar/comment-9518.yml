text: "I&#39;d arranged to meet the one Grinnellian, and the other Grinnellian was in town to meet her, and so was the Cincinnatian, but we didn&#39;t discover we had a hometown in common until a few minutes into talking.<br /><br />Today I got a yak wool sweater and a plastic raincoat. Maybe a garbage bag would&#39;ve been a good option, but I was looking for something that would help insulate slightly better. Sort of a layering system: T-shirt, yak wool sweater, plastic raincoat. Might need improving. We&#39;ll see."
