text: "Don't let the elusiveness of answers frustrate you too much. I have been struggling with many of the same questions for more than three decades and I am not all that much closer to finding satisfying answers than I was at the beginning.  That does not mean that my life has not been rich and fulfilling and satisfying.  It means that the journey matters more than reaching the destination.  <br/><br/>Any path you choose entails risk.  Isn't it better to take a chance on seeking genuine answers that satisfy your intellectual integrity rather than seeking to suppress the questions and doubts in the hopes of finding mindless comfort?  I would find it very hard to believe in a God that preferred the latter.<br/><br/>Best of luck to you."
