text: "Hey, we are both kind of in the same spot, except I jumped over one side of the fence to the other.<br/><br/>A couple of things I have learned in my search for truth: Defending atheism is just as hard if not harder than defending or supporting chrisianity. We all know of questions that we cannot answer, even if we do not accept christianity. The beginning and ending of time for instance.<br/><br/>About nature- CS Lewis writes about it in \"the four loves\".<br/><br/>If you take nature as a teacher she will teach you exactly the lessons you had already decided to learn; this is only another way of saying that nature does not teach. The tendency to take her as a teacher is obviously very easily grafted on to the experience we call \"love of nature.\" But it is only a graft. While we are actually subjected to them, the \"moods\" and \"spirits\" of nature point to no morals. Overwhelming gaiety, insupporable grandeur, sombre desolation are flung at you. Make what you can of them, if you must make at all. The only imperative that nature utters is, \"Look, Listen, Attend.\"<br/><br/>        ----CS Lewis, The four loves<br/><br/>I would recommend \"Surprised by joy\" by CS Lewis, it follows almost exactly my path to chrisianity.<br/><br/>Dave"
