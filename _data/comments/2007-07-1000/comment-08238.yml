text: "I was wondering how long it would be before you wrote these thoughts.  For over 18 years you've had the comforts of home, the familiarity of place, the ability to get around on your bicycle or have someone else drive you somewhere, the security of your local school.<br/><br/>Then, when it happens, it happens all at once: a new home, a new college, new people, and the requirement to get yourself back and forth, not to mention coming up with the money to do so.<br/><br/>So of course it's hard to believe, and it's a little scary.  But as your Grandma said, Iowa is a great place.  And Grinnell will stimulate you in ways you haven't imagined.<br/><br/>This is life.  You have just realized you are crossing the threshold and leaving your childhood behind you forever.  There are new responsibilities for you, but you are up to the challenge.  You'll do fine.  <br/><br/>Welcome to adulthood!<br/><br/>Aunt E."
