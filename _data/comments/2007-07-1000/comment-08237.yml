text: "Hah!  Those who belittle Iowa don't know Iowa.  Iowa just seems to be everybody's favorite state to mock as being all farmer hicks.  Don't be afraid to go there, that's for sure.  There is a beauty to the whole state that you won't find here.  People who are wonderful, and smart, sophisticated ones who live in Iowa rather than any other state by CHOICE.    Iowa will be good for your spirit.  And by the way, there are a lot of early birds there, too, so if you change your ways you will find lots of company.  Grandma"
