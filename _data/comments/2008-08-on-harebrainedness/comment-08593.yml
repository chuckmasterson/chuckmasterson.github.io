text: "I think you underestimate the inventiveness of the human mind.  No fossil fuel left?  Then how about solar power?  As Ellen once reminded me when I was groaning that we were using up all our sources of power, there is a sun out there, at least for a while yet.  And there are still a lot of trees in Alaska for fuel.  Or even grasses can be burnt.  I don’t think we’re quite at the end of the world just yet.<br/><br/>And I don’t think an economic correction would be such a bad thing, especially a nice slow one, though it might be difficult for us to accept that we would be a lot richer if we were a little poorer.  Right now we are spinning wheels at the top of the heap and we are so glutted with goods that we have lost all our perspective.  I’d like to see us lose our reputation as the world’s First Class A-One Glutton.  Let somebody else have that title while we figure out what’s really important on this earth, and it ain’t the almighty dollar.<br/><br/>Watch out, I have a lot of two-cent pieces to spend speaking my mind!<br/><br/>Love, Irene"
