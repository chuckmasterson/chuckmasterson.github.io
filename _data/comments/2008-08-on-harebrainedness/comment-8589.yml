text: "All right, I'm coming in late to all this stuff, except by indirect communication, but I'll put in my own two cents all the same.  <br/><br/>Having just been in Alaska where the worldview is a lot different, I can offer another perspective on the survival stuff.  Alaskans are still in that 'not-so-many-people-but-a-lot-of wilderness' stage of civilization.  They are laid back and far away from the problems in the main part of the USA.  They are friendly and generous and they help each other out because that's what survival is all about.<br/><br/>We also learned a lot about the goldrushers, who survived incredible conditions in their search for riches, and they did it by hanging together and helping each other out.<br/><br/>Okay, that said, I'm thinking about this wilderness stuff and realizing that it's not very likely that anybody will end up alone in the wilderness to survive by themselves.  More likely survivors will band together to provide their common needs.  <br/><br/>Now, the electrical infrastructure may collapse, but the principle of electricity will remain.  The laws of supply and demand will remain.  And I can confidently predict that somebody will be out there in the 'wilderness' making electricity to trade for somebody else's sewing skills who'll trade those skills for somebody else's brewing ability, who'll chop firewood for the old lady who cooks and sells hot meals, who'll start to run an inn for the refreshment of weary wilderness dwellers, who'll happily come and enjoy the hot showers and baked beans right out of the oven with the fresh bread, and somebody will start to make butter, and so on and so on and so on...  remember, the people who really got rich in the gold rush were the ones who could supply the needs of the would-be miners.  Dawson City grew to provide all the amenities of civilization for all those starved folk who worked so hard and so cold trying to dig wealth out of the permafrost.  <br/><br/>So the skills you need to learn are the ones needed for basic living in a society.  Survival in the wilderness is something you do if you have to, before you can get to a settlement where other people do some of the hard work and share with you.  Dan and Dave have got it right.  Learn farming,  butchering, mechanics, electrical engineering, plumbing, sewing, cooking, printing, bookmaking! etc. etc. You'll survive.<br/><br/>Irene"
