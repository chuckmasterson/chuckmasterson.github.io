text: "I don't think that the anti-gloom and doomers,(if there is such a thing) are reading this right. Do I think 1929 is right around the corner, or at least could be? Yes, I believe our entitlement economy built on american comfort and the promise of a perfect all the way to the grave life, will eventually cease to exist. Energy will take a long time to run through and WE will not see the true effects of the fossil fuel endgame. But, it is coming, and in geological terms, it will be but a nanosecond.<br/><br/>Learning survival skills would always be a good thing. In 1929 and shortly thereafter, people did whatever they could to get by including some of our relatives.<br/><br/>Is it really such a stretch of the imagination that things could get really bad for a period of one to ten years or more?<br/><br/>Nothing is forever including any brief fall of civilization. Fossil fuels will run out though and I for one am not convinced that our american ingenuity will \"invent\" our way out of this.<br/><br/>I won't be around to see what happens but anyone has my Kudos for reassesing and not reassuming.........<br/><br/>Dave"
