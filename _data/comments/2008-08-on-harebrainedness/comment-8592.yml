text: "I know full well that primitive people lived in groups. Some of them lived at settlements; others were nomadic. That's the reason that, in my previous post, I was enthusiastic about the possibility of some people joining me in my second year of GO if I do it for two years (or at all).<br/><br/>Now, the thing is, if everyone's living in these groups, they'll also be fairly well dispersed without much dependable contact between them. So, it'd be difficult for the sort of barter economy you're thinking of to completely fledge. Of course, there would be specialists and trading, but I don't think it could make a brand new civilization.<br/><br/>Also, the reason civilization wouldn't just restart is that we've exhausted easily obtainable supplies of metals and fossil fuels. If we want to get at these things, we need the tools that civilization allows. To mine more metal these days, you need fossil fuels to get down deep enough. To mine fossil fuels, you need at least an initial investment of more fossil fuel to get to it. Metal is salvageable, but at high cost, and not in huge quantities. If we've got no oil and no metal, civilization can't really rekindle."
