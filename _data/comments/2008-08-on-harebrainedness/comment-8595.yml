text: "We already have the technology to say goodbye to fossil fuels. The problem is way more political that substance.  The transition to solar energy is already happening and is picking up pace. This might be a “shock” to some of you but we can build cars that run on electricity!  How ‘bout that pun?  The central problem with it (or any other alternative fuel) is infrastructure.  No one wants to spearhead an infrastructure overhaul to make less money than the existing oil infrastructure!  My point is that when things really get tough enough, things will change.  It’s basic economics, supply and demand. Doomsday averted.  Asteroids are a more likely cause for alarm, really."
