text: "Aht, what did I say about the copula? It's a copula whether there's a word there or not. Just deleting all the forms of \"to be\" isn't E-Primitive. Rather, you have to rewrite the sentence so that it doesn't require that verb. So, you could write, \"Grandma thinks Nathanael won't feel very happy if Nathanael has no pronouns ...\". And \"Grandma would feel very happy then.\" It does make sentences a bit nicer in moderation, which is why Professor Savarese recommends cutting down on \"to be\". It's the idea that you should ban it entirely that I think is pretty misguided.<br/><br/>And, if I recall, Grandpa, one proponent has already written something on E-Primitive and called it \"To Be or Not\". As to your question about the crazies, they just seem to come with the territory in this pursuit. I guess when you have a small group of people all dedicated to a cause radically different from civilization's aims, you're bound to find some who think any change from the status quo will improve things. All it takes is a catalyst to make them all rally; in this case, it was Jason's article, which apparently was derived from a few other prime champions of the cause who came up with the idea. The Urban Scout Jason mentions is the founder of the forum I mentioned in the blog post. Willem is on the forum too.<br/><br/>P.S. I can't take it anymore; I have to put the pronouns back in. \"I think you won't feel very happy if you have no pronouns, but I think you should study linguistics, for sure. Under the stars, on your cot, at night in your yard. That would make me happy.\""
