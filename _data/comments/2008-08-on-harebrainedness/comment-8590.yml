text: "And in one feld swoop, she crushes Mr. Primitive’s idea of living alone in the wilderness gnawing on some nasty killing for sustenance.<br/><br/>The word primitive in the sense that you use it implies that you are going to disregard modern conveniences in the event that they will someday cease to exist.  As Irene so rightly points out, civilization when toppled, will always rebuild from the ground-up.  More importantly modern technology will still exist and the evolution of such a civilization will move at a fervent pace to replace what was lost.<br/><br/>I’m sorry, but Mr. Primitive’s whole idea is merely a science experiment to see if he can do it, albeit completely unnecessary.  If civilization gets so bad that no modern technology exists, you had better be a cockroach because you’ll need to survive the fallout and to my knowledge, no primitive skills have mastered the art of fending off radiation.<br/><br/>Now, on the other hand, being Mr. Primitive might be fun and why not try it now?  It won’t hurt you so go for it!<br/><br/>Dan"
