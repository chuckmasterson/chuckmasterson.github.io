text: "What a well-written account.  Thanks.  Now I&#39;m eager to hear about the project.  I didn&#39;t know you were doing linguistics, but it sounds like an excellent choice for you.  Did I ever tell you I have a friend who got a PhD in linguistics and actually teaches at Gallaudet College helping hearing people to become deaf interpreters?  She&#39;s on sabbatical this year and I think she might be in Brazil at the moment, but I might be able to get in touch if you had any questions.<br /><br />Irene"
