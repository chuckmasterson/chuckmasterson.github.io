text: "Glad you got to do some neat things after we left.  Now, I&#39;ll have to offer you some of my wine when you come to visit.  Waiting for your pictures, too.  Mine were excellent, and in the book already.  <br /><br />And I&#39;m also glad you wrestled with your project while being a hermit in your room, and I&#39;ll be glad when you announce that you have sent it in.
