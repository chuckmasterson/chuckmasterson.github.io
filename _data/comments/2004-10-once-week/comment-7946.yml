text: "I just backtracked to your \"that\" post because I realized I never actually checked it out.  Turns out I had already seen that somewhere else and downloaded it.  My AIM expression is actually by the same guy who made \"Ze End of the World\".  If you wish to expand your internet palette you should find \"Cows with Guns\", \"Potter Pals\", and \"Potter Pals 2\" on google or something.  You might especially like http://www.cybermoonstudios.com/8bitDandD.html since you have an obvious distaste for RPGs.  Also, are you ever going to download AIM again?"
