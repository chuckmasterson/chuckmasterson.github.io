text: "I've reconnoitered those cartoons you suggested, and here are my opinions:<br /><br />\"Cows with Guns\": Just plain weird.  Nearly pretty funny.  The guy doesn't seem to know that \"cow\" refers only to a female and that the males (bulls) don't have udders.<br />\"Potter Pals\": Okay, it was kind of funny, but they screwed it all up at the end with the \"Naked time\" thing.  That wasn't funny at all.<br />\"Potter Pals 2\": The critic raves: \"Better than the original!\"  \"Still pretty creepy, though!\""
