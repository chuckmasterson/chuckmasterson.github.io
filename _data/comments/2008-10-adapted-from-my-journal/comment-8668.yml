text: "This is my suggestion. It doesn't really fall into the primative training you are seeking, but, I think you should consider hiking the apalachian trail. To make it, you have to start in northern Georgia while the snow is still melting. You couldn't go primative so to speak, more of a minimalist lesson. You would learn so much about survival and self reliance and it would be the adventure of a lifetime. I know you read a walk in the woods. If you actually made it to Maine, you would be one badass in shape survivalist quasi family legend. You would meet and hike with some of the best survivalists there are. From there a move to privativism would be a cakewalk.<br/><br/>Dave"
