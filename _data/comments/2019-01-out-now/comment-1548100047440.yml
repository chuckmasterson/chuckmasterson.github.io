text: "I've thought of that now and then. I don't read those kinds of magazines enough to feel confident writing something for them---maybe I should pick up a copy one of these days and see what their articles are like. See how much they make me want to say, \"Oh, *I* could write that.\" Glad you liked the story!\r\n\r\nPeople have suggested I write my hitchhiking travels up into a book, and I've thought about that, but hadn't been able to come up with a way to link them all together that would satisfy me---the project kinda felt like it would be an indulgence, a bunch of travel stories for no real reason. I think a week or two ago I may have come up with a way to unify it all, though. I won't say more because I don't have it thought out enough to say more, but it could be good. I think there'd certainly be enough material for a full-length book."
