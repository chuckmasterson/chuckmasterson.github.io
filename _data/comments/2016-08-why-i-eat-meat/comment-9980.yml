text: "The way I see it, both of you have substituted a &#39;natural consciousness of, and deference to sin&#39; with a more physically qualifiable alternative. We all feel the weight of human failure, and now that we as a society have for the most part ditched God; we must now apply these feelings of guilt to something else that &#39;matters&#39;. Instead of looking up, admitting that life is not solvable, and crying out for grace from God, we instead are &#39;Gods of the planet&#39;, constantly tending to the mire of our failing planet, ecosystems and such. Intellectual giants, yet spiritual midgets. History will eventually unmask our societal narcissism, and yes, it is narcissistic to believe we control the fate of our planet, ecosystems or anything for that matter. More intellectual parsing and chronological snobbery just leads us further down the rabbit hole."
