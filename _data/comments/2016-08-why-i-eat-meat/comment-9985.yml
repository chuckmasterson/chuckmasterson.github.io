text: "<i>Copied over from a comment I left on Sean&#39;s blog after reading it.</i><br /><br />And so we dive deeper. I’ll give this a closer read sometime soon and figure out what I think about it. For now I’ll let you know that when you got me to write the post that I wrote, it forced me to clarify my thoughts to myself, and from that I’ve already realized that, for far too long, I’ve been convincing myself that “mostly eating well-raised meat but occasionally having some factory burger” is as good as “strictly eating well-raised (and freegan) meat”. I’ve decided to get much more serious about skipping meat altogether if I can’t verify that it has a good provenance. Thanks for shaking me up a little and reminding me that it’s not enough to dream of the day when I’ll be virtuous, I have to do it starting now."
