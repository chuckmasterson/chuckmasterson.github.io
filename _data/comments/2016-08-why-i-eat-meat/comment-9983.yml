text: "Dave, that&#39;s simply a third system of ethics. Although I think the system you&#39;re describing in your comment may be more strict than the one you live by. What you&#39;ve described is, basically, a system where the proper worship of and supplication for grace from God are the <i>only</i> things that matter in life – I base this on your scare quotes around &quot;matters&quot; when it&#39;s applied to worldly things. But I&#39;m guessing you probably believe that those are actually the <i>primary</i> things that matter, allowing for the possibility of others.<br /><br />Consider: Suppose that I&#39;m a devout Christian who agrees that communion with God should be the main goal of life. Suppose also that I still wrote the above blog post, pointing out that deriving ethics from nature makes sense in the context of Christianity because nature is the creation of God and He is immanent throughout it, whereas there are well-known historical translation and transmission problems with the Bible, enough to make some of its books suspect as sources for modern ethical decisions (while allowing other sections, like those that deal with the nature of God and the method of salvation and communion, to stand intact for guidance). And suppose that I pointed out that none of what I wrote is meant to replace worship, but simply to deal with the question of how we can best live our Earthly lives.<br /><br />In this case, do you still argue that the whole issue is irrelevant? If not, then we don&#39;t really have a disagreement, just a difference in the domain we assign this question to. If so, then your worldview is closer to Christian Science than I thought.<br /><br />Assuming you didn&#39;t mean to imply that Earthly life is irrelevant, I&#39;d say that your comment is an illustration of the old adage that &quot;when the only tool you&#39;ve got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&quot; Your tool of course being religion – and you have other tools, you&#39;ve just forgotten about them because you haven&#39;t opened your toolbox for a while.<br /><br />Incidentally I agree that in many cases (not all) it&#39;s narcissistic to believe we <i>control</i> the fate of the planet or its ecosystems, but not narcissistic – in fact eminently realistic – to believe that we <i>impact</i> their fates. Inasmuch as the planet, ecosystems, and us are all real, we are definitely impacting them in real ways, often (in the case of ecosystems) including their complete destruction – and I would say that if you can destroy something, then by definition you have control of it."
