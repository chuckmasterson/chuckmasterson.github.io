text: "Dave, sorry- though I agree with you, I don&#39;t think that was Nathanael&#39;s point. If you read carefully, he is trying to say we need to live WITH nature, because we are part of it, and not try to go against our human instinct to live peacefully with nature, which includes the death of individual organisms. Nature is predicated on the death of organisms so that other organisms can survive; ultimately all organisms die. That is why God in his wisdom designed the wonderful phenomenon of reproduction. Nature is designed to die and be reborn, over and over. But I digress. Nathanael&#39;s point was to rebut the trendy decision to become vegan because it is based on the false assumption that we can somehow become more moral than nature itself.  from Ann /Mom"
