text: "Really? Congrats, Dan &amp; Tracy! Just can&#39;t get enuf of being pregnant, can you, Tracy? I&#39;m looking forward to spoiling more!<br /><br />And yeah, chickens are dirty, or at least so I&#39;v heard. I&#39;v also heard that, pound for pound, chicken is less nutritious than cockroach. I&#39;m glad rabbit was my first experience with meat up-close and personal. <br /><br />Incidentally, last nyte I went over to Erasmus&#39;s house and helped cook the rabbit. It was a big production, and a lot of other peeple wer making food too (borshch, cake, baguettes), and Erasmus was making some Rotkohl and Spätzle too, so it was a confusing dinner and it took a long time to make. But eventually it got done and everyone pritty much feasted. The way we did the rabbit was we wrapped the separate pieces in bacon, which Erasmus claims was to keep them from getting too dry since they hav virtually no fat. He red about it online somewhere. And then, since the rabbit was small, we supplemented it with lamchops. (Yeah, it was a heck of a production.) And then we broiled it on a grate suspended above some vegetables in water. It ended up delicious. Rabbit has a dark, wyld kynd of flavor. Erasmus says he&#39;s not shure he&#39;ll go to all the effort involved in rabbit again, but I know I&#39;m going to sometime. Probably not while I&#39;m on campus, but sometime, maybe on my semester off, depending where I am then. It&#39;ll be nice not to hav to try to make it stretch for nine peeple, which was the crowd we had there. And I&#39;ll probably try cooking it without the aid of bacon… maybe I&#39;ll figure out a way to rig up a spit to roast it over a fire. Or maybe I&#39;ll make Hasenpfeffer, since I like rabbit and I like pepper and I like the word &quot;Hasenpfeffer&quot;. If I hav some time when I catch it, maybe I can even try tanning its hide."
