text: "You are unknowingly picking up where your great grandparents left off.  They hunted and ate rabbits and squirrels from the farm.  I&#39;ll bet even Grandpa has had some experience cleaning dead animals.  He&#39;ll tell you.  <br /><br />As for me, I remember my Dad, in a sudden inspiration for getting back to nature, bought a couple of live chickens, brought them home, and chopped their heads off in the back yard.   I remember those chickens hopping around with no heads.  And then it stunk in the house when they had to clean off the feathers.  That was the ONLY time my Dad, who was completely city raised, tried to go back to nature.  I&#39;ll never forget it.  I don&#39;t think he ever did, either.  Grandma"
