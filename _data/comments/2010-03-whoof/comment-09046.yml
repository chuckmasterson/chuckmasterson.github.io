text: "I leave on I think the 21st. I&#39;m going to like it, but I&#39;d like it better if I didn&#39;t have to do so much research while we&#39;re there. The professor has stressed that it&#39;s not going to be a big vacation, and we&#39;re going to be doing a lot of research for the whole break, all around the town and the co-op. We do get a day on the beach or doing a zipline. I think I&#39;ll have more fun when I go to the Ecuador (country still tentative)... less academics, more physical labor, more time for fun."
