I knew the Japs were in a bit of a pickle on this subject and this website<br /> <br />http://www.economicshelp.org/blog/economics/list-of-national-debt-by-country/<br /><br />backs me up. Otherwise, I would say that S. Korea would be a great choice.  Incidentally, Hyundai and Kia are the same company, and Hyundai Samsung and Daewoo dominate the world in shipbuilding."
