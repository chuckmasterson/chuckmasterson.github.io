text: "Dan, there&#39;s a difference between &quot;I&#39;m going to fast because Jesus said so&quot; and &quot;Look at that, science and logic say fasting is good and so do a bunch of different religions&quot;. I&#39;m mentioning religions not because of any spiritual aspect of them but simply because they&#39;re old, continuous traditions. Traditions, especially the ones that really endure, tend to have some basis in sense, and when several traditions all hit upon the same thing and it&#39;s backed up by research, that seems like grounds for paying attention. Even Sucharit doesn&#39;t fast while saying, &quot;Lord Krishna, please witness my supplication and bless me.&quot; He fasts because he feels that it gets toxins out of his body. Dude&#39;s not just a yogi, he&#39;s also a neuroscience postdoctorate fellow."
