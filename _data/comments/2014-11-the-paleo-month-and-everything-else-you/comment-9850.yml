text: "That is ny profession(Dave). Fasting works well for me and a large portion of the world.  The post modern westerner sees no validity in fasting. In a fit of chronological snobbery, much of the world now only believes in objective truth. I believe, and most all of our ancestors believed in objective AND subjective truth. I am firmly in the camp that the universe has a theme that can&#39;t be explained by objective truth only, it is explained by both objective and subjective truth. I don&#39;t believe that living in the Å«p to date parsing of knowledge brings revelation to much of anything(recently bias, or chronological snobbery if you wish). Mostly what I see is bread and circus(Rome), avarice, technological obsession, and an insatiable thirst for novelty and entertainment(more bread and circus). It&#39;s nice to see you searching for truth, not much of that happens anymore. 100 years ago or more, casual conversation likely centered around philosophy, religion, the search for truth. Now a philisophical conversation brands you an outcast. It&#39;s not proper small talk in mixed company. The sad part is, nobody even realizes how far we&#39;ve deviated from &#39;normal&#39; as measured by the last 2000 years."
