text: "I don&#39;t know the specific tenets of the Atkins diet, but I believe I&#39;ll probably be closer to the Weston Price diet in the end—I don&#39;t think Atkins made any mention of fermented stuff like kimchi, sauerkraut, injera, and kefir, or of the importance of high-quality meats, but the Weston Price Foundation explicitly does. Come to think of it, <i>I</i> didn&#39;t make any explicit mention of that either. There are several things I forgot to put in this post—and here you all must have thought it was already longer than it could possibly need to be. I believe I&#39;ll add a bit to it soon, and I&#39;ll mention which things are new.<br /><br />Seems like over half the people who eat bread believe they could never give it up because they&#39;re just in love with bread. I&#39;ve seen a convincing case made that bread is actually physically addictive because some of its proteins get converted into endorphins. After I&#39;d been off it for a few days, I stopped wanting it nearly so much. Now when I eat it I actually notice the impulse to eat more and more of it. It&#39;s weird to realize that&#39;s there. Mom said once she could never give up bread, and she hasn&#39;t really, but I remember that for a while she did, and she mentioned that after a while it stopped seeming like anything close to as big a deal as she&#39;d always thought it was."
