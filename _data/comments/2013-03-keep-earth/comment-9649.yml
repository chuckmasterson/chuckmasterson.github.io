text: "Good luck. Short of talking the entire civilized world out of industrialization your efforts will be moot. Your biggest enemy is not big oil, it is mainstream western society. You can&#39;t even get the populace of Europe or the United States to even believe there is a debt crisis. We will have to do with less, whether its wealth, entitlements, prosperity however you measure it. If you can&#39;t pass this blatant gauntlet of information without revelation, climate change activism stands no chance.<br /><br />I believe history will judge this era the &#39;second dark age&#39;. We have all the data, analysis, conjecture, information to exact change. All of this is not enough to crack the scourge of the western world&#39;s narcissism.<br /><br />Dave"
