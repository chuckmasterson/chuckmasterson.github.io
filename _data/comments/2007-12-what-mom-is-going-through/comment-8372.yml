text: "Hi Chuck,<br/><br/>It was actually the reference to Lee Strobel that drew my eye to your website.  I started reading his books last spring after being challenged to “check out the facts” by some evangelical Christians.  There was a local school board campaign going on and we were debating how the high school curriculum should handle issues like sexuality and evolution.  They seemed to think that Strobel’s writings would convince me that the Bible would be a good guide for the curriculum.  It will probably not surprise you to learn that I found his <i>Cases</i> less than overwhelming.  Since that time, I have monitored the blogs periodically to see what people are saying about Strobel.<br/><br/>Your post reminded me of my experience with evangelical Christianity as a teenager.  I was raise Catholic, but I was “born again” as a senior in high school.  I remember being very disappointed when I read Josh McDowell’s <i>Evidence that Demands a Verdict</i> because the objective evidence for my faith seemed much less impressive than I had been led to expect.  As time went by, I found it more and more difficult to share what God was doing in my life at Bible study because I realized I was still the same confused guy I always had been.   I liked the friends I had made, but I knew that I was claiming to have found peace or joy because I was supposed to have found it, not because I really had.  I got the feeling that others were in the same boat.  After about two years, I concluded that life did not work that way and I gave up the faith.<br/><br/>Luckily, my decision did not cause any conflicts at home.  My mother was a devout Catholic who thought it was nice that I was going to Bible studies, but did not spent much time worrying about my theology.  After raising nine children, she pretty much expected that we would all have to work out our own understanding of our relationship with God.<br/><br/>BTW, I am very envious of the education you are getting.  I visited Grinell two years ago when my son was looking for a school.  I thought it was great, but he could not stand the idea of being out in the middle of the cornfields and chose to go to Madison.  UW is a excellent large school but I think that there is a lot to be said for excellent small schools."
