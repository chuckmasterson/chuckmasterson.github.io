text: "Sorry I'm not as rugged as you would wish. I'll try harder! I'm back on the diet again and when I get to the goal weight Gerry's gonna give me yet another book. (We had that deal once a long time ago. I lose 15 pounds, he gives me a book, and I picked an Italian language instruction book.) <br /><br />Sorry also that all the snow melted. It's melty out. MELTY."
