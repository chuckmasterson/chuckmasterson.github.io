I hope she likes it when she grows up.<br /><br />On a lighter side, the formula for coming up with your personal porn star name is to take your real middle name as your first name and the name of the street you grew up on as your last name.  porn stars don't need middle names.<br /><br />Mine is \"Mark Hilltop\" Sweet huh?<br />Tracy's is \"Ellen Red Coat\" even better! Cammy's is \"Marjorie Michael\" well, maybe this system needs some work. I think Grandma's would be \"Virginia Leclaire.\""
