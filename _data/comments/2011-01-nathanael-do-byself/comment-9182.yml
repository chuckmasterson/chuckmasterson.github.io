text: "Wait a minute... I never said you wouldn&#39;t get anything done if you travel and adventure.  Actually I support that 100%. I just said that &quot;loose plans&quot; can also be a cover for not having a plan at all.<br /><br />When I was 1 semester away form graduating I took 3-4 weeks in the summer and traveled the west. Part of what helped me make my destinations was planning and deadlines.  I had 5 dates over the weeks where I had to be somewhere to meet up with people. that kept me on track and I was able to see tons of fun stuff over the 8,000 mile journey. Driving up the west coast from San Diego to Seattle was something I will never forget.<br /><br />Kudos to you on your projects, they all look really good. I like the stamp, the design is not too complicated and that makes it better to me.<br /><br />I stand behind my comments about the stink-laden hippies of the rainbow gathering. I&#39;m sure many of them are nice enough people, but damn they need to get a life."
