text: "I did leave my <i>Chicago Manual of Style</i> up there. I may have to take you up on that... if I do, I promise to let you know in enough time to bake ginger snaps.<br /><br />I need to add about 9 days to the adventure total, because I somehow forgot about Oregonâ€”I guess because it happened so early in the semester. The number is still low, but I did do some interesting stuff. I don&#39;t think I can really count the &quot;lessons in family communication&quot;. Partly because I haven&#39;t managed to solve anything around here. Micah&#39;s set in his ways for the time being, until he figures out what his best interests really are, and Mom&#39;s still smoking. But I guess I have learned a little about that."
