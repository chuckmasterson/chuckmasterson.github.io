text: "Oh. Well, I also have a series of dates that I&#39;m planning on making over the course of the year. These are dates that I can&#39;t move, and they&#39;ll keep me on track for the year. I am a little wary of scheduling it too tight, though, in case, say, I hear about something really cool that I want to do when I&#39;m at the Rainbow Gathering, but that time is already blocked off on my schedule for the year. I suppose I can always schedule over things if I need to. Another thing is that I feel like it&#39;ll be hard to make really firm plans for the year while I&#39;m in Korea, and I might have to find out what I&#39;m going to do as I go along. But nonetheless, here&#39;s approximately what I&#39;m thinking right now:<br /><br />Summer: Gatherings, like the Rainbow Gathering, Hobo Convention, and wild foods get-togethers.<br />Fall: WWOOFing, since this is harvest season. I&#39;ll get in touch with a WWOOFing farm ahead of time, of course.<br />Winter: Building houses in New Orleans or Galveston. I hope this is a thing I can actually do. My roommate Hannah did an internship at such a place last year (and loved it and never stops talking about all the cool people she met&#42;), so I&#39;m going to talk to her all about it.<br />Spring: Some self-directed time spent living off the land as much as I can in a National Forest or something comparable, since I want experience like that.<br /><br />&#42;Here&#39;s one such person: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot-inf5zkvw\" rel=\"nofollow\">the frontwoman for Dr. Something and the Pipin&#39; Hot Love Engines.</a>"
