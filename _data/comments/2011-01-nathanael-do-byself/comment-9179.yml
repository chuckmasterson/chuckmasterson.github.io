text: "Have you realized yet that you did way more adventuring this semester than you had planned?  You&#39;d planned long train trips and bike trips.  And what did you get instead--short bike trips, luxury plane trips to Oregon, lessons in family communications, a JOB, a boring job that should be everyone&#39;s first lesson in adult life, and lastly, YOU MADE STUFF!  Neat stuff!  Stuff that no one knows how to make well.  Or badly, for that matter.  Do you realize how well rounded that makes you, instead of some hippie type who just managed to jump on a train?  You are a work in progress, and it is wonderful to watch how you make something out of nothing, time after time after time.  And I&#39;m not just talking Scrabble, although you always clean my clock.  <br />Speaking of which, why don&#39;t you come up here soon and play with me on the new Scrabble board.  It&#39;s luxurious.  If you do, I promise to make you a batch of ginger cookies.  Grandma"
