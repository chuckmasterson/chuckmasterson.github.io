Your tour by bike maybe is harder than car or other convinient transportation but from your story it gave you more lessons. A lesson that not only useful for you but also for readers include me. I wish you stay happy and healthly  \r\nAutumn is somehow show the sign already here in Korea. If i have time i will go to hike and see what beauty lies in Seoraksan during autumn."
