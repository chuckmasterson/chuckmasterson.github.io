The sale is scheduled to start on June 13 and end when it reaches the hard cap of $4.9 million. \r\nidax, however, is not the first one to get into this new foray in cryptocurrency. OKEx, Binance and Bittrex are already in the IEO internet business. \r\nThose who may be confusing IEO with Initial Coin Offering (ICO) must know that these two are diverse. According to experts, IEO becomes increasingly popular because provides many more advantages than its counterpart. \r\nWhat is an Initial Exchange Offering? \r\nFirst of all, IEO is a form of ICO; some call it a better version today. Unlike ICO which you are not a crypto-wallet can avail, IEOs are exchange-specific. Remain you need to surely be a user of the exchange that is offering it and buy the token using your account involving exchange. \r\nICO vs IEO \r\nIt'd be difficult to declare a winner in war between an ICO with an IEO. Some prefer ICOs because it is open to public. On paper, features the familiar more odds of raising means. However, investors have started being skeptic about ICOs; you reasons for the. \r\nAnyone who are going to convince investors with their white paper can raise money through ICOs. Generally than not, the technology involved on business is unknown. Also, no 3rd party monitors ICOs. Scammers have been using this opportunity in previous to collect funds lousy . \" deliver is actually promised. \r\nRELATED NEWS \r\nBitcoin extends losses, down more than 20% to below $6,300 \r\nRise of smaller rivals throws up fresh challenge to bitcoin \r\nWhat works best IEOs is that the exchange which launches it monitors the process as the website owner. If an investor trusts the exchange, they can be assured of protection of its IEO. This also means the reputation for this exchange is due to stake. In case the IEO goes down, it appears to consider the exchange down south by using it. \r\nIEOs   Advantages and Cons \r\nThe sensation of risk is much lower in IEOs, as well as that's may be reason enough to get more investors. Reputed exchanges get their own research and verification process help to make it sure that the token is legit. Users should be more confident while buying IEO tokens just because they do n't have to trust a half-known startup but to go with the exchange that is significantly more believed. \r\nNevertheless, like several other investment option, IEOs too get their limitations and risks. The most important question is that you should trust an exchange. Although there are numerous cryptocurrency exchanges around, very few of them can be trusted. Most of them are usually accused of poor security and management. \r\nAlso, various blockchain experts are against IEOs offered it is against the videos . value of the technology: decentralisation. When an exchange oversees the process, it simply controls the revenue flow while blockchain and cryptocurrency are fundamentally against any style of third-party control. \r\nIn a collaboration with IDAX, kuverit will be holding an IEO to fund their new cryptocurrency convert. The exchange will support cryptocurrencies, fiat, besides other securities. Boasting a big list of partnerships, kuverit hopes it can emerge being an industry patron. \r\nHowever, what really caught our eye about kuverit was that it seeks to host STOs. Securities will be going to traded on kuverit through its own STO marketplace scheduled for you to become unveiled inside the fourth quarter of 2019. Inherently decentralized, most for this traded tokens will be on Ethereum, including ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens. \r\nkuverit may have some fierce competition from existing security token platforms, however, like Tokeny and tZero. \r\nThe Standard Tokenization Protocol, or STP, is a decentralized network that allows any asset to be tokenized. But unlike other token platforms, compliance, validation and KYC/AML functions are made directly in the blockchainallowing issuers to guarantee that everyone holding their token is following the rules of their jurisdiction. \r\nannounced that the protocol could unlock trillions of dollars in value, by that easier to trade and issue wedding party. \r\nThe cost-prohibitive nature of traditional funding methods has led a new rapidly increasing demand for solutions that simplify asset offerings, said Chen, in an argument. STP inside a unique position preserve billions of dollars for companies and startups that are unable to attain funding because the costs involved with hiring security lawyers, accountants, and investment banks. \r\nIn addition, Chen suggested, the project would also help help the crypto economy as a whole, by reducing illiquidity premiums and that easier to maneuver value. \r\nInitially, Block72 <digital>asset investment bank] set in order to support the crypto ecosystem by helping blockchain projects around the world, he told Crypto Briefing. <B>ut projects are only half the equation.

Like some other recent IEO's, the cap has been set relatively low compared to the excesses of the ICO model: STP hopes to raise $750,000 out from the sale, with individual contributions capped at approximately $2,500. 75 million tokens have been allocated for the sale, with a maximum supply of 2 billion STPT. \r\nBittrex International has already launched several token sales, with mixed success. The first IEO, RAID, was cancelled after the termination of a key partnership, as Crypto Briefing reported. Another, Ocean Protocol, was considered a flop by some investors after the token price collapsed   although has since recovered far. \r\nBut that does not seem to bother the STP team. We're very excited to be working with them, Chen told Crypto Briefing.We decided to travel with Bittrex International because their community, like ours, is global, and also the platform allows users to more tokens in comparison to other IEO platforms. \r\nThe IEO follows two private sales for the STP project, which raised a total of $7 million from prominent VC's like Neo Global Capital, BlockVC and Alphabit.
