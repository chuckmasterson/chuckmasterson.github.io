  Thanks for taking the time and effort to put your thoughts into well written
  words.  You definitely need to publish this, as your Mom suggested.  And
  thanks for remembering Vi.  As for the flu epidemic of 1918, your 7-year-old
  Great-Gramdfather B. nearly died from it.  As for us old people, our time is
  near no matter what.  Nobody gets to go on for more than 120 or 130 years, and
  few for that period.  So the best I can say to you is thank you for making my
  own family legacy, Dear Ella and Tom, happen.  You've a real source of joy.  I
  wish you and Misty a happy life together.
