  Your perspective is the most cohesive, cogent, and widespread-audience worthy
  I have seen BY FAR. CV19 is quite a nasty little beast and people who feel
  well may still have and transmit it. Hence the quarantine. Donna had to be
  quarantined too for 2 weeks because she hugged someone who 4 days later tested
  positive. I hope and pray Misty does not have this. It is ridiculously easy to
  catch. I think that, this thing being so novel that we are just beginning to
  see how this thing behaves, some overly judicious and careful folks may be
  taking precautions that in hindsight will have proven unnecessary. I hope you
  bear no ill will toward them while this thing plays out. It seems the malaria
  med may be able to manage some symptoms in some people. There are many who are
  being very very careful. There are others whose cavalier attitude is aiding in
  its fast spread...rich young Venezuelan revelers in Los Roques who imported
  some (unknown to them at the time) CV19 positive hookers from Spain and had a
  good old time and now are almost all sick; partygoers in Florida flaunting
  their purposeful ignorance and now all sick...the litany goes on ad nauseum.
  Because you are young and healthy please do not assume recovery will be 100%
  if you contract this. It remains to be seen how much lung and other organ
  damage by oxygen deprivation is permanent. Fully recovered survivors may soon
  be regarded as having superpowers: Some ever-coveted antigens...the golden
  sword at the end of this great and game-changing global shift in paradigms.
  Much love, Mom
