  You may have gotten me on a kick of learning what it was like to live in times
  gone by. One of the stories that I'll be working on soon is, as I imagine it
  right now, about hoboes/trainhoppers in three different centuries, around
  1920, 2010, and 2110. The idea certainly came in part from reading Uncle
  Ernie's story. I'm happy to be preserving the past to some extent, even making
  it come alive.
