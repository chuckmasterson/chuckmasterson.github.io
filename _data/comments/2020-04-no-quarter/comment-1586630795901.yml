  Certainly, there's always some young people who are vulnerable, even
  vulnerable with no idea they were. Those are tragedies. I'm being careful, but
  ultimately I'm still resigned to the possibility that I'll get it sooner or
  later, because by the numbers, this thing's going to rip through some 30--70%
  of the population, and that kind of math is hard to stay outside of. I'll
  certainly be pleased if I never do catch it, but I'm not banking on that.
