text: "A couple of observations. It is a well written piece, but nobody’s listening. The cacophony of continuous Covid lectures has long since eroded any sane person’s ability to ingest anymore Covidity. I mean honestly, everyone has a soapbox to pitch in on the national “scolding brigade”. Enough is enough, I think that’s now self evident in all of the public apathy.\r\n\r\nThe other observation. I think you’ve backed your way into an apologetic on materialism and property ownership. When push comes to shove and you have nothing, living hand to mouth, you’ll likely get nothing in return. Philosophical platitudes, alternative constructs, alternative ways of life get tested and in this case seems like they failed. If you at least have your own small piece of land and a few possessions, you’re in a much better position to weather these storms.\r\n\r\nThe right to life is the source of all rights—and the right to property is their only implementation. Without property rights, no other rights are possible. Since man has to sustain his life by his own effort, the man who has no right to the product of his effort has no means to sustain his life. The man who produces while others dispose of his product, is a slave.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that the right to property is a right to action, like all the others: it is not the right to an object, but to the action and the consequences of producing or earning that object. It is not a guarantee that a man will earn any property, but only a guarantee that he will own it if he earns it. It is the right to gain, to keep, to use and to dispose of material values.\r\n\r\n    -Ayn Rand"
