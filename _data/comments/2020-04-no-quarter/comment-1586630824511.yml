  I considered as I was writing this whether it might make some sense to look
  for someone to publish it, since I haven't seen anyone else with this thought.
  This week I have internet only when I sit outside a closed cafe or library, so
  it's hard for me to research possible outlets for this, but starting next week
  I'll have a trickle of connectivity again, and I'll be able to look into
  whether publication is a goal that makes sense. I can think of a couple places
  it might conceivably be a fit, but whether those places take unsolicited
  submissions from barely-established authors with no particular qualifications,
  I don't know.
