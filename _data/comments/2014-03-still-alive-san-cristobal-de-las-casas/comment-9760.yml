text: "The line between a professional wanderlust traveller, and a meandering vagabond is a thin one.<br /><br />Try South America. While I&#39;m not hitting the lost places, I overfly them all the time. I look down and see remote, very remote settlements on the faces of the Andes mountains. Lots look like they are perched on 30-40 degree inclines. Most would be next to impossible to reach, except for people like you. I look down and always wonder what a hard, but incredibly peaceful life they mus lead.<br /><br />Dave"
