text: "Examined purely on the level of language, it’s perfectly logical that if one’s gender is hazy then the language used to refer to them should communicate that haziness.<br />However, I doubt most people’s usage of the non-gender defining pronoun is based on comprehensible communication and accurate understanding of the language. The usage is deliberate, one has to make a little brain contortion to get to “them” instead of “he”.  This kind of contortion is unfortunately idiosyncratic of ‘you and others’ (yes, I’m putting you in a box but it’s a box with no name, no top, bottom or sides, a nebulous box, you’re not confined to this box but your debate regarding “them” exists only inside the box and is floating around in there with you, if you try to take the debate outside the box it gets blown out of your grasp in the wind currents created by mostly everyone vigorously shaking their heads in despair, clear?). <br />It’s a curious contradiction that the alleged free-thinkers and outliers of America – those who say what they think and do what they want, those who feel estranged from the mainstream current and foster a philosophy of radical change at their core – should so willingly present their balls to be constricted in the vice of political correctness (I realise this term has been appropriated by ‘the right’ in America to moan at lefties but it retains its impartiality in the wider world). It conjures the image of the snake devouring its own tail. Self- flagellation of the open-minded: “we want to change the world… in our very own insular way that feints to make great strides of progress on all fronts – equality, peace, fairness, environmental protection, animal welfare, agrarian diversification… and so on – yet stutters halfway through every stride as we’re distracted by the slightest peripheral flicker.” This is what bothers me about your opinion piece, it’s a divergence and you’re only one of many who’ve wandered down this aimless divergence. From what I know of your philosophy, it’s to beat against the flow not get stuck in whirlpools.  Don’t be that raggedy flag of the left that does nothing more than flap around in the wind shouting anti-capitalist slogans that are so hackneyed they’re hollow. Knock on this topic of “them” and it will reply with that hollow reverb. I only make a point of saying this because you’ve ostensibly been courting a philosophy of change (however amorphous) for a while now and if even someone with an independent mind like you cannot filter out the self-made, accumulated dross that smothers the left and movements for a different kind of society, then it doesn’t speak well of the health of societal progress (I only say ‘left’ because it’s easy, not that it accurately describes your position).<br />Really alls I’m saying is you could and should put your (somewhat athletic) mind to something more effectual. For example, get to the land, farm it, and write about it already. <br />"
