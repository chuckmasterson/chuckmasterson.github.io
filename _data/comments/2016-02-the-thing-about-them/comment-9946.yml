text: "Very very interesting entry. I myself identify as a woman, very happily so, I guess ciswoman, or cisgender? Something like that. I have always been very content and never felt uncomfortable with &quot;she&quot; for me. I love being female. Being pregnant with you and your brother definitely reinforced that for me. Loved feeling a baby move in me. Loved feeding you with food my body made. It is an absolute joy to be a female. That said, I realize some people (you know the person) are not comfortable with being the gender their body was born as. The person we both know prefers to be a &quot;he&quot; and likes men still so in his mind he is a gay male. However, I saw him grow up as her and I still remember &quot;feminine&quot; features, he still has a XX body in an XY brain...it&#39;s all so confusing. But I don&#39;t give it as much thought as you have. I was going to say some other things but thought you probably would not publish this if I did. Anywho, please use &quot;she&quot; for me from here on out. That&#39;s one issue that has never plagued me myself. I love being a female. I am a female spirit in a female body. Does it matter to me personally if someone identifies as ze, zie, hir, them, or anything else? Not particularly though it may behoove me to keep it all straight in my brain while using casual conversation. -Mom"
