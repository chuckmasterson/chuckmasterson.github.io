text: "As Bill Clinton said, &quot;it depends on what your definition of is is&quot;.<br /><br />This is much ado about nothing. Existential naval gazing at it&#39;s best.<br /><br />Gender confusion is nothing more than dysfunction seen through a prism of titillation, novelty, and PC voyeurism.<br />Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit to that arrogant oligarchy who merely happen to be walking around.” – Orthodoxy, 1908 GK Chesterton.<br />"
