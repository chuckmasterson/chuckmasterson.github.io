text: "Tradition is great when it’s not as dysfunctional as ours. But our civilization has inherited a lot of dualistic, essentializing, inflexible thoughts from philosophers from Plato to Descartes to (being generous with the definition of <i>philosophy</i>) the Christian fundamentalist movement. If you look at cultures that are more egalitarian and in tune with their environment you find traditions that are vastly different. I believe we’re in a phase where we need to build new traditions. Look where our old ones have gotten us.<br /><br />As for “gender confusion”, a lot of people you’d put under that umbrella are perfectly clear on what their gender is: “None of the above,” no confusion involved. Calling it a non-issue is a classic example of “It works for me, so it ought to work for everyone.” An attitude like that is what convinced the pioneers that Indians would totally be better off with private ownership of land—not to equate that with what you said, since it’s clearly tremendously different, just to point out that they come from the same origin and that origin often produces bad results. As long as we’re slinging old quotes, “There is more in Heaven and Earth than is dreamt of in your philosophy.”"
