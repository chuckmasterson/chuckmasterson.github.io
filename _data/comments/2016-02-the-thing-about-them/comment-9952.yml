text: "Russell! I didn&#39;t know you ever ventured over to my crevice of the internet. How the hell are you doing?<br /><br />So I gather that in your opinion the whole issue of gender-neutral pronouns is (1) not important and (2) distracting everyone from what is important. But when you list the issues that (what we&#39;ll agree to conventionally call) the left should be trying to make real progress on—“equality, peace, fairness, environmental protection . . .”, the first one on there is equality. I’d submit that recognizing people’s gender identities as identities that belong to real, valid people is as important a part of equality as validating people’s racial or ethnic or religious (etc.) identities. Which is to say, I don’t think the issue is a distraction. There’s not just one avenue to make progress on, and no culture (and no individual progressive) has to finish one before moving on to the next. That’s why I think about this stuff at the same time I’m planning on getting to the land.<br /><br />But I know exactly what you mean about progressive movements getting bogged down and stalled out in mires of details. I think when that happens you’re looking at a classic hallmark of the problems you get from trying to change a culture from the top down. The social justice crusaders who want to change the behavior of <i>everyone else</i> (those dumb rubes), by policy or by the questionable tactic of “raising awareness”, are prone to oversimplifying, which often ends in simplifying a complex issue into one bugaboo (over here the environmental movement has chosen the Keystone XL Pipeline) and focusing all efforts on that. Bottom-up change is much more complex, diverse, genuine, and lasting, and for what it’s worth, that’s the kind of change I think this gender-neutral pronoun issue represents. It’s far from the only gender-related issue that people in these communities are talking about; it’s just the one I wanted to talk about, one detail in a large system of broad social change that’s groundswelling right now, at least where I am (I don’t know much about anything that’s going on in Scotland these days, last news I heard from over there was that you voted no on your referendum). <br /><br />Rest assured, I haven’t stopped thinking about everything else, is what I’m saying."
