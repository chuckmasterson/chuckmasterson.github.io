text: "Imagine someone referring to you as <i>it</i> and you’ll see why we don’t use that—it’s really dehumanizing. Neither one fits exactly right, but between calling someone more plural than they are and calling someone less human than they are, I’d definitely go with the first one. Having said that, you might be interested in Octavia Butler’s <i>Xenogenesis</i> trilogy, where there’s a race of aliens with a third sex that’s consistently referred to with <i>it</i> pronouns."
