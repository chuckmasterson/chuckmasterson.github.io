text: "The short answer is that my plans haven&#39;t really changed much, except that the timing of them is constantly changing. Right now Misty and I are looking at more or less a year before leaving the city. <br /><br />I&#39;m probably not going to blog much about plans for the future, though, unless something big changes in the plans - because the broad outline is there, and that&#39;s about all I feel confident in predicting. Details are always shifting. That&#39;s how the future works. It never goes quite where you think it will, so I&#39;m going to mostly stick to the past, which stays put, and that way more of what I say will be true."
