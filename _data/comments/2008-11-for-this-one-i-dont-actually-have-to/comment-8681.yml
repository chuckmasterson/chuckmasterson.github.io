text: "And everyone on our side is not \"left-wing\", either. Grandpa Blaser was quite a Republican and fiscal conservative. We have a good mix of Republicans and Democrats. Jerry is really conservative. I mean, come on. Do you know what everyone in our family really thinks? Likewise, in Steve's extended family there are lots of political colors. Get a clue. <br/><br/>Also you have NO clue what Steve had to deal with over there- it was not easy and he is really having a hard time dealing with it. <br/><br/>For my opinion, I think this: Saddam was a tyrant to the Kurds. I think he and other despots have to be stopped. How to do that, I don't know. I'm a humanitarian. I believe equally that the Hutus and Tsutsis shouldn't slaughter each other. But the US doesn't care because it's black people killing other black people and in our country it's inconceivable to too many that blacks can hate other blacks. So millions of people died in one of the worst genocides ever and the US doesn't do squat. Because they didn't have anything we wanted. Iraq is a strategic place militarily, and it had to do partially but not wholly with war. But despots need to go, but he should have been deposed a long time before this happened. The US did too little too late and I don't believe in bombing and killing as a good approach. Even after 911 when we started bombing Afghanistan I think it was just returning one evil for another. And Al Qaeda is still strong. So the interventions we need to do are humanitarian, NOT military. We (or any one) who has the strength should get rid of whatever impediments are in the way to get humanitarian aid to whoever needs it. Al Qaeda needs to go because it oppresses women and everyone with their suppression of human rights. Or, better yet, they need to change and become a group of people who don't do this. I say they become Quakers. :)  OK I know that's rambling but I'm all about being humanitarian and using force only to defend the weak."
