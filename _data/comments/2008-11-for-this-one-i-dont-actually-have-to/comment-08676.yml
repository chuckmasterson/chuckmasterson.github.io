text: "Why not take the trickle down(or up) theory of economics to it's ultimate limit. It is clear now, that I do not have the fiscal wisdom to manage my money. Therefore, I wish to trickle it up to the closest corporation or person in my neighborhood who is in the seven figure range. Then I can just wait for it to come back to me in shower of economic prosperity. Cut my taxes while we are at it to multiply the reward. Write a bunch of IOU's to China, Russia, and the middle east.<br/><br/>You are right and wrong about Greenspan. He is the champion of derivative fiscal vehicles, and was the oracle of so many democrats and republicans for many years. We were all equal clients to the whore of fiscal genius.<br/><br/>He was appointed by Reagan, so all partisans of the last 20+ years can have some of the credit.<br/><br/>Face it, we are in the restaurant and all of us want to dine and dash. But we, all of us have to pay this bill, and it's a whopper.<br/><br/>Dave"
