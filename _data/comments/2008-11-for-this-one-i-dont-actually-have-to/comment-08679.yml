text: "Chuck,<br/><br/>Forgive your father for his right-wing thinking.  I’m sure the last 8 years have been very difficult on him.  Going to that charade of a war and having to deal with the incompetence of the U.S. Army must have been and still probably is very hard to deal with.  Of course, he has been a part of a very right-wing family and that makes it hard to see both side of the coin.<br/><br/>I think you were lucky to have grown up with a right-wing family in your dad’s side and a left-wing family on your mom’s side (excepting your mom).  It is clear that someone as intelligent as you sees through the garbage and has learned to decide for yourself, even if it means turning your back on some of your family.  I applaud you for standing up for what you believe in.<br/><br/>I suspect in many ways it is easier for people to continue believing what they know is wrong because admitting the truth to themselves is too hard.  I wish I had some recordings of FOX News from the 2000 and 2004 elections, I suspect that the crap they spewed was completely wrong.  But you sure don’t see them bringing up their past.  They are just like the weathermen, when it’s a complex situation, they are usually wrong.<br/><br/>I am jealous that you were able to vote for a winner in your first presidential election, it took me 5 tries.<br/><br/>Dan"
