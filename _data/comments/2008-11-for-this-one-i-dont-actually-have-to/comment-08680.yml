text: "Dan, why do you presume to know what I think? Just because I often disagree with YOU does not make me extreme right-wing. It just makes me someone who often disagrees with you. But this isn't the blog to pick fights with me. Do that on your blog or mine, not Nathanael's. I know you always think you know what I'm thinking but you do not and that's the primary disagreement I have always HAD with you. You presume what I think. Don't do that. I will tell you what I think (or don't think). Don't presume or infer from me."
