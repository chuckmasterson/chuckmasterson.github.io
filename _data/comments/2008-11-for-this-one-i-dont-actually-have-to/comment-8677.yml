He was from Reagan, so my point to Dad mostly still stands.<br/><br/>Dave, you sound like you might actually get something out of the primitivist-type books I've read (just a couple so far, but they've impressed me). I don't usually recommend them because I know the person usually would either never read them, or would call it insanity, but you could well see reason in them. Have you thought about finding one of them at a library?"
