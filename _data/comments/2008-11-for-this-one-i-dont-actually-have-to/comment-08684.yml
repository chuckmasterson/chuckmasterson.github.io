text: "I wasn't trying to pick a fight with anyone.  I was really trying to defend Steve and his right to think and vote the way he sees fit. I guess I didn’t do a very good job of that. I also clearly stated that the past 8 years must have been very hard and that his experience in the war must have been difficult as well. Where's the fight there?  I never claimed to know what he had to, and still deals with from the war!<br/><br/>The only reason I stated that you have “right-wing” thinking, not “extreme right-wing”, is based on the letter that was posted.  You have to admit it is filled with distain for the left-wing.<br/><br/>The last sentence in the first paragraph of my post was poorly stated, all I meant by not seeing both sides of the coin is that people that gather with others that have the same ideals sometimes find it hard to see the other side of an argument.  It is true for everyone, regardless if you are left or right-wing.  I’m sure it’s true for me.<br/><br/>When I stated right-wing / left-wing families, I meant immediate family that he regularly confers with, not Nathaniel’s extended family that he doesn’t regularly confer with or people he never knew at all.  I don't really know what all of their beliefs are.<br/><br/>For the record, I didn’t even know Steve has a blog. Send me a link."
