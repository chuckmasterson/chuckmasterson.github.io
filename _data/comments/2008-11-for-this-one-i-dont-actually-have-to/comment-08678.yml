text: "Addendum: I went back and wrote the stuff down. This is how it went:<br/>A:— This planet is not a tool or a resource for us to exploit.<br/>B:— Why not?<br/>C:— Because Deleuze believes that, like, rainforest machines have rights too, ya know?<br/>D:— An utterly non-Deleuzian concept. What were you thinking? Try a liberal for rights-discourse; Deleuze doesn't play the rights game.<br/>C:— Sorry, my bad. That was irresponsible.<br/><br/>Deleuze refers to Gilles Deleuze, a French philosopher. I looked him up and, like all philosophers, he seems a bit spacey. I don't have a lot of patience with philosophy once it starts using the special secret philosophers' code that no one sane can understand. But you can see how this argument reduces the fact of our destruction of the planet to a philosophical matter, rather than a very real physical concern that should be near the very top of most policy lists. (What's actually near the top: making sure businesses in your district don't go bankrupt; raising money for the next election cycle; keeping the stock market from bucking too violently. Derrick Jensen observed that if there's a real problem with the physical world, the powers that be will study it for years and years before finally doing something extremely minimal and ineffectual, but as soon as Wall Street looks shaky, they'll hand over hundreds of billions of dollars \"before you can say 'rip-off'.\")"
