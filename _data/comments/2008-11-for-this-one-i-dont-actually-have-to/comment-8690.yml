text: "I knew the letter that was posted was from Steve, I just didn't know the first response to my comment was Ann's and not Steve's.<br/><br/>For the record, I admire Steve's dedication to his country and willingness to serve.  I also supported him during his tour, as I do all our troops.  I'm just not happy with the way we got into the war and the continued path our outgoing adminstration has handeled it."
