text: "The pencils should be up on top of my rolltop desk, on the right side, in little boxes of 12 that say Ticonderoga. Alternatively they might be in the desk. I&#39;m pretty sure there&#39;s nowhere else they would be. If you totally give up and insist on buying more, I know you can find #3s at Staples.<br /><br />As for the headphones, if you can&#39;t find them, ask Micah. If he doesn&#39;t know where they are, don&#39;t buy me a whole new set. I&#39;ll just borrow someone&#39;s. I had a pair of earbuds of my own, but I misplaced them, so maybe I can even find those."
