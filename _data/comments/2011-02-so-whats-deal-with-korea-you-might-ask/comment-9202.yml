text: "I agree with both Dave and Ann.  The 50s were indeed optimistic and upbeat, but in retrospect we females were being discriminated against horribly, and we didn&#39;t realize it until later.  A lot of women my age got hurt terribly when they bought into the 50s fantasies and got socked with the 70s and 80s realities.  I was lucky in most respects, marrying a good man who treated me with respect.  But for sure the 50s weren&#39;t the Fonzie-land some people think they were.  Grandma"
