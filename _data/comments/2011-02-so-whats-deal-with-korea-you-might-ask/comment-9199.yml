text: "At the risk of stating the most obvious thing ever, Tahiti sounds nice. <br /><br />Today I made aloo saag instead of those pork chops. I was inspired by that Indian restaurant we went to. It turned out not too bad, but it could have used more spices. I have a feeling that Indian restaurants go through spices like they&#39;re nothing. Whenever I next need a meal for myself, though, that&#39;ll be pork chop day."
