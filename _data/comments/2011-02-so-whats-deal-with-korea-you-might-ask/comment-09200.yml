text: "No wonder you don&#39;t want to leave college. You are the alpha male in an &quot;eco-hippie-sorority-society&quot;. Who would want to leave that?<br /><br />You might find Korean culture refreshing. Right now I am in Santiago and it has more of a monolithic veneer to it also. Things I don&#39;t miss: rudeness, uber-inked bodies, piercings, underground subculture and all of its associated malaise, spray paint grafitti, basically, all of that american overcompensating &quot;idividualism&quot;.<br /><br />This country is in full stride. It is so full of optimism you can feel it in the air. Anyone, from any class is in a far better place than they were 30 years ago. It&#39;s like having a taste of America of the 50&#39;s, when we were in full stride, hitting on all cylinders.<br /><br />I suspect some of the same flavor is in Korea.<br /><br />Dave"
