text: "It is just a matter of time before you get into linguistics in some way.  It is fate.  And if my hunch is right, you&#39;ll do it in a unique way that will also pay some bills.  (But you won&#39;t get rich!)  Anyway, GP and I just got back from Tahiti, well actually, the Society and Tuamotos islands in the south Pacific.  You could have a really good time there trying to understand the culture. It&#39;s fantastic.  Anyway, the recipe for pork chops is really simple.  Just brown them in a little olive oil, turn over and brown the second side, then add a can of golden mushroom soup, maybe fresh mushrooms and onions, and cover and braise for about an hour.<br /><br />You could substitute regular mushroom soup.  Or experiment with something you had lying around--veggies, peppers, whatever.  You could even make sweet-sour by adding pineapple and green peppers.  I bet you can come up with a lot of things.<br /><br />Anyway, we&#39;re glad to be back but severely missing the perfect weather in the perfect paradise on earth.  Grandma"
