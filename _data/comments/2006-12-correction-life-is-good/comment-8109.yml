text: "O.K., O.K., 3:00 a.m. in the morning.  A head light can also be used by dentists (filling teeth), physicians (saying ahh!) and by grandmas that have a very dark sense of humor (lighten up).  It will come in extremely handy should you go to Carleton College in Minnesota where in the winter night comes early and the morning light comes late.  It will also be helpful for night ice fishing, night flying and seeing the night in a gale.  Finally, but certainly not last (if this litany must continue in the future) this head lamp may shed some light on dark matter that sometimes occurs at 3:00 pm in the morning.  Thus the confusion of time.  It is not immemorial but rather about as stupid (as well as funny) as most of the other comments on this blog.  Gpa"
