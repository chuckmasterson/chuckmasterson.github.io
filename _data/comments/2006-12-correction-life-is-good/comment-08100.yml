text: "There's no way we would NOT do the Crow Duck trip with everyone who wants to go.  Start getting your reels and lures ready.  It's coming up in late June.  And I agree.  It's much better to live life than to play games that simulate living life.  And Im glad you found a use for the flashlight.  Grandpa seemed to think you would.  Love, Grandma  Ps.  I had a botched (doctor pierced a hole in my bowel, letting stuff get into the intestinal cavity and which would have been fatal if left unfixed) colonoscopy and had to have my bowel partly removed and my innards rearranged by open abdominal surgery.  That's why I was not up to par, it's supposed to be six weeks of recuperation."
