text: "I want you to be able to go to Crowduck even if I (Mom) do not. I don't know if I will this year. However, being as that you will, I prefer that you have your license and assist in the driving. You will probably go with your dad and little bro. Your dad has lots more vacation from his job than I do. I do not think Dave will go, which is very unfortunate. It is too much. I hope I'm wrong. <br/><br/>Maybe if just a few go, there will be a lot less drama. I know the drama doesn't concern you in the least- just enjoy fishing and the solitude.<br/>-Mom"
