text: "Some people use runes to try to divinate. I think they were used by the Druids and still are. Surprising that the Romans didn't quite kill them all in 16AD. <br/><br/>Anything used to divine the future (tea leaves, tarot cards, runes, horoscope, Chinese calendar, chicken bones, hanging chads, kaleidoscopes and annoying wind chimes) are hooey. I prefer to put 100% stock of my future in a God who is 100% accurate.<br/>Mom"
