Examples include night hiking (where one needs to use their hands for other purposes such as a hiking pole or grabbing on to rocks or tree limbs), night fishing, where one needs both hands to remove the fish,  night poker playing <br/>( especially at Crow Duck) when the lights go out, going to the bathroom at night when you do not want to turn on the big light and you are feeling your way along the walls), getting to the ideal place for star watching or watching the aurora borealis (also at Crow Duck, washing your hands at 3:00 pm in the mornin in the dark, just because now you can and almost any other night activity.
