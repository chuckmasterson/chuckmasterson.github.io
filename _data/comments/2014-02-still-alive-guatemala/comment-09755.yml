text: "I don&#39;t have the patience or connection speed to bother writing another whole Still Alive post, but I am still alive, and just finished a walk of about a day and a half between Todos Santos Cuchumat√°n and Nebaj. Long, tiring walk; now I&#39;ve got a cheap hostel where I can hose myself off. Not sure what&#39;s next."
