text: "My Aunt Ellen left a few answers on my mom's blog.  She says they can be chorus, haphazard, mishap, and thyme.  Close, but here's the problem:  The ph has to be pronunced as a p, not as a p-h.  It would have to be pronounced \"hapazard\".  Likewise with the sh: It would have to be a \"misap\".  And I guess it kind of was.  But good try! <br />-Oh, and I think she left it on my Mom's because \"This Blog Does Not Allow Anonymous Comments\".  I'll try and fix that."
