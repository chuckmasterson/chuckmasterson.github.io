text: "Thanks for allowing the anonymous posting.  As for the words, dishonor or dishonest gets around the pronunciation barrier, because the h is silent in the root word, but sh is still not a diphthong, if that's a requirement.  Speaking of diphthongs, the ph before th is, in my old dictionary, pronounced as f in such words as diphtheria and ophthamology.  Is this still the case?  I hear so many people pronounce those ph's as p.  Also, how do you pronounce the oo's in oophorectomy?  The dictionary says one way, but I've heard medical people say \"you-for-ectomy\" and other variations.  (Don't ever have one!)<br /><br />Aunt E."
