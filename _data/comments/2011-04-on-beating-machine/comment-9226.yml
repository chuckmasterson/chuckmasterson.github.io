text: "No no no. I expect I&#39;ll shave, and even cut my hair if I have to. I&#39;m not going to give up the Korea job because of hair. That would be idiotic. As for lingering in adolescence, what? What does long hair have to do with adolescence? Joe&#39;s had long hair for longer than I&#39;ve been alive. Cutting my hair isn&#39;t growing up, and if I have to cut it, I still plan on growing it back out when I get back to the US."
