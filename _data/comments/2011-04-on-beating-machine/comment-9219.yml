text: "Aimless and boring?  Never.  Your laziest writing is better than the very best that most of the world can put together.  Never forget that, because right now I assume you are surrounded by egghead type Grinnellians who would have to write well or wouldn&#39;t even be there.  So your perspective is a little skewed.  But, the real world awaits you, and it&#39;s very exciting.  And I hope those gingersnaps will help your energy level, but I&#39;m also glad you&#39;re going to get some sleep, too.  Grandma"
