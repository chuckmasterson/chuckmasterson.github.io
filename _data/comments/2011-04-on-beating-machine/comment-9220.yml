text: "Don&#39;t worry about keeping us addicted to your internet addiction. Just scribble some stuff down and some relative from future generations can publish it all posthumously.<br /><br />My latest resolutions is to read older books. Next up is G.K. Chesterton&#39;s &quot;The Everlasting Man&quot;. I am sold on CS Lesis&#39; assertion that &quot;modern thought&quot; handicaps us as we are all blind to the age we are in, and this internet age is a VERY blinding one in my opinion. He(CS Lewis) recommended that ANYONE who reads, should read older books to keep &quot;the fresh breeze of the ages&quot; always flowing through your mind.<br /><br />Chronological snobbery is a killer.<br /><br />Dave"
