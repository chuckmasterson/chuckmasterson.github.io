I accepted that I would have to change, but complained about it and wondered just how much of a change it will have to be.<br /><br />I guess you think I&#39;m going to choose my hairstyle over Korea? I don&#39;t know. What part of this is making you think I&#39;m immature and not ready to be an adult? I don&#39;t get it."
