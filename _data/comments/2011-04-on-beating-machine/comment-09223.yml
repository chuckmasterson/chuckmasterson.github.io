text: "Well, of course going out and experiencing the culture comes first. I aim to disprove all the Americans who go there and say Korea has no culture. But once I&#39;m about six months in I&#39;m betting I&#39;ll have exhausted all the big things to do in my area, and I&#39;ll be left with small things like occasionally playing baduk (if I actually find people to play it with... I hope so, because it&#39;s darn fun) and eating at restaurants, plus big things that require a weekend trip or something. Around the time I start hitting that point is when I&#39;ll probably start cracking books. And some other stuff, like working on my fonts, learning guitar, and maybe writing a book, if I decide I know enough to write one that I&#39;ll find meaningful."
