text: "That&#39;s an interesting thought. I haven&#39;t been reading much old stuff recently, because a big emphasis in scholarship is to be up to date with the very most recent contributions to the literature. But I do like old books, and I&#39;ve been thinking of grounding myself more in them once I have time. I&#39;ve never read John Bunyan, or much of Mark Twain, or Wordsworth&#39;s poems, or a lot of stuff like that. Ironic that in order to read this stuff I probably need to finish college first. I&#39;m actually looking forward to learning a lot after I graduate. I&#39;ve asked a couple professors for syllabuses to read from once I&#39;ve graduated. So I can learn about ecology and hunter-gatherers and stuff. I actually might have four syllabuses to take to Korea once I finish gathering them... so I&#39;ll be taking a full courseload if I keep up with them. Minus the assignments, of course."
