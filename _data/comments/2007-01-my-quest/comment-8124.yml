text: "We are talking a different generation here.  I am working on a real document to pull all this together, but for now let me say that Buddy was Great Grandma Ellen Hilbert's grandson, not her son.  Buddy's father, Ellen's oldest son, was named Harold, and he was in the Navy at sea in 1936 when his wife in California suddenly died, leaving 20-month-old Gina and 4-month-old twins, Buddy and Pauline.  Your Great Grandma and Grandpa and some of their kids left South Dakota to go to California to live and take care of Harold's children.  There was no one to nurse Buddy. <br/><br/>Jeanne was a poor farm girl from South Dakota who wore overalls, talked funny, and was ignorant of young girls' sophisticated California social structures.  She was overwhelmed and unaccepted by her classmates.<br/><br/>Aunt E."
