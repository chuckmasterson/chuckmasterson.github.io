text: "Those are the titles you read for fun??  Good heavens, I suffered through those for AP English and that was enough of that.  I went back and re-read the Grapes of Wrath a couple of years back, at Thanksgiving (mistake) and all I can say is what a depressing book.  If you want to break out of your mold a bit I can recommend some good mystery books, many sci-fi and fantasy books.  Perhaps they aren't your genre but since I live in reality every darn day I read for escape and enjoyment.  If I could figure out a way to score myself a dragon I would be one happy camper.<br/><br/>Dylan and Austin recommend Captain Underpants but they are 5 and 8 after all.  Hank the cowdog is great irregardless of your age.  Sense of humor required however."
