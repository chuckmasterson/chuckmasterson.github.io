text: "\"Thoreau always retained a belief, even if at times residual, that God`s mind lay behind nature, and the world of the microscopic, the insect, crystallized his perceptions on this - \"What kind of understanding was there between the mind that determined that these leaves should hang on during the winter, and that of the worm that fastened a few of these leaves to its cocoon in order to disguise it?\" As a writer he was concerned to capture - in words - the miraculous detail of nature. \"<br/><br/>What I have always called The Fingerprint of God...the more you observe the creation of God, the more you can see His mind at work.<br/><br/>(I'll give you the essayist's name later- have to go back for it-)<br/><br/><br/>Mom"
