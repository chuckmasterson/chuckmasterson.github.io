text: "How about a little Tolstoy? Wait a minute- Tolstoy only comes in large doses. Ditto for, who is it, Cooper? Now there is a person whom many criticized for being loooooong-winded but JH Cooper created some memorable characters (Natty Bumppo, e.g.) and I really loved Last of the Mohicans. No one describes the New England autumns like an author who can spend a page describing the sound of a twig breaking (Hence the nickname for his books \"Dry Twig Series\").<br/>Mom"
