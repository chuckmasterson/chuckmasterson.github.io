text: "I recommend Sinclair Lewis.  I read both Babbitt and Main Street many years ago and was very impressed by them.  Don't suppose you are considering Dickens?  Is he too mundane?  Oh, right, he's 19th century.  I could recommend Les Miserables and The Count of Monte Cristo for classic French novels.  I had to read the Count of Monte Cristo in seventh grade and really liked it even then.  And if you like classic short stories, read Guy de Maupassant.  His stories are the best, probably even in translation.  Grandma"
