text: "I reread The Grapes of Wrath a couple of years ago also, but I had the opposite reaction of Toy's.  It gave me a far greater understanding of what my own grandparents and Don, Tommy, and Jeanne had to face when they arrived in El Monte in 1936.  Jeanne, particularly, who was about 11, was ridiculed mercilessly by her new classmates.  Grandma had to grow a garden for their food, and raise a goat to milk so baby Buddy could survive, as he was allergic to cow's milk.  Depressing, maybe, but that was the real world then.<br/><br/>Aunt E."
