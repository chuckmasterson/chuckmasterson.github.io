Even though it can get a little slow at times, it is a GREAT period piece and about small-town Minnesota, no less, and paints a great picture of the Scandinavian immigrants who were considered so ignorant by the rest. I still think about Carol Kennecott's contemplating that her children might live to see the year 2000.<br/>Your old mom"
