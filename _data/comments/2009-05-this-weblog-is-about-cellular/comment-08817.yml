text: "Grandma is talking about my Facebook status, which says I just got my first design commission. (I still maintain that it's unnatural for one's grandma to be on Facebook, but that's another matter altogether.) The commission is for the guy I worked with at CERA. He wants a logo for a prairie landscaping service that he's starting up this summer. Someone reminded him that I do font design, and so he offered to pay me some money for a logo. I'm pretty stoked. I just gained a résumé builder, and I'm helping out a friend, and I'm getting some money. Not a bad deal."
