text: "We're in Lincoln, NE, tonight, probably will get to Grinnell sometime around 2:00 or 3:00 p.m. Tuesday.  We won't try to stay until 8 p.m., though.  I don't know how to find you, though, with no phone number.  I'll do the best I can.  If we miss you, perhaps we'll see you at a later date.  Sorry you can't come in August, but your GOOP program takes priorty, for sure.<br /><br />Aunt E."
