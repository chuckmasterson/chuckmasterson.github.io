text: "You can use any phone on campus to call my room, which is extension 9052. To call from off campus, the area code is 641 and then you just put 269 in front of the extension. That'll reach me if I'm in my room. I gave you my number all piecemeal because who knows, maybe there are spambots out there that collect numbers for telemarketers."
