text: "Cell phones sometimes do make life a little easier.  Like if I called you when we were in Newton heading for Grinnell to see if you were free.  Since, however, you didn't send me any phone number (cell or land based) where I could reach you today or tomorrow, as I mentioned in my Facebook note, I am going to assume you will be too busy during finals to want us to stop by.  That is absolutely fine, as we don't want to do anything to mess up your finals week.  <br /><br />I haven't seen Grinnell's fall schedule, but I hope you will still be able to come to our anniversary celebration on August 15th, plus or minus a day or two.  You can see my invite on Facebook.  You also don't have to decide until the time comes, but I do hope you'll think of adding it to your summer schedule.<br /><br />Love, Aunt E."
