text: "If you have learned to take your enjoyment from every single day as it happens, and live in the present, then you will always be happy, especially if you are in harmony with nature.  Because if you were to wait until your retirement to start living, believe me, you've missed the boat.  Anyway, you sound as though you really like what you are doing, Emerson excepted, of course.
