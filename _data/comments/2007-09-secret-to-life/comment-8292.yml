text: "Ok, can we see Into the Wild already? This is getting me more pumped to see it. I say go for it. The paradigm of life we live in will change eventually and gravitate to something like what you describe. I for one, think there is going to be no magic energy bullet, and we(our society) use far more energy than is sustainable for the planet on a 1000's of years basis. Or another way of saying it is, It's gonna run out, the millions of years surplus of energy we are blowing through.<br/><br/>The journey of life is the prize. An endgame surrounded by excess is a dream I no longer aspire to.<br/><br/>Dave"
