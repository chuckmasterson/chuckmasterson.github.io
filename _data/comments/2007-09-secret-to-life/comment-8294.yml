text: "You make \"work\" sound as though it is something you do only for money to pay bills.  Work can be very rewarding too, especially if you are doing waht you love and are in control of what you do.  I love working for myself, I enjoy ever day to the fullest.  True, money is a barrier, but it is possible to work very hard initially and forgo some of your other hobbies in order to retire early.  Question: Would you trade 10 years of your life to hard work after college, for the reward of retirement after the ten year investment?  It is possible, especially if you want to live as a minimalist.  You can do it, but you would have to be very disciplined.<br/><br/>Dan"
