text: "Right, oil demand will eventually rise back up to the level of production (or more likely the two will meet somewhere in the middle). <br /><br />The middle class may be growing in some places, but each population where it&#39;s growing is offset by a population somewhere else that&#39;s getting poorer. Real wealth is currently a zero-sum game, or a very slightly positive-sum game, because we&#39;re only able to extract from nature a tiny bit more than we need to keep afloat at our current levels of consumption. And we have to count real wealth: money can be as imaginary as you want, but the middle class lifestyle is defined not by amount of money but by the consumer products you&#39;re talking about. <br /><br />Those products are not the engine of the global economy, and neither is the money needed to buy them. Both of those things have to come from somewhere. The products have to come from real factories that burn real fuel. The money can come from a deluded government by way of quantitative easing, but that kind of imaginary money can&#39;t actually create real wealth, only redistribute it, whether nationwide or worldwide.<br /><br />Things seem bleak here because we&#39;ve been the beneficiary of a leviathan worldwide redistribution of wealth since WWII, and that time is drawing to a close. Back then we could keep expanding our piece of the pie because the pie was growing bigger and bigger all the time, so everyone else was like, &quot;Eh, let &#39;em have it. They seem cool and also they have nukes, and we&#39;re still getting our chunk.&quot; Now the pie has stopped growing but everyone in the world still wants their slice to keep getting bigger, because their populations are growing and all those third-world countries were promised spuriously that first-worldliness would trickle down to them.<br /><br />Our claim to the biggest slice is built on a very elaborate house of cards made of deceitful financial devices, imperial intimidation, and a fa√ßade of respectability. Those things are all reaching their expiration date."
