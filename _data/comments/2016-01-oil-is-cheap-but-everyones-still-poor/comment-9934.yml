text: "It&#39;ll take me some time to digest all that, so I&#39;m limiting my comment to wondering why your typed &#39;fi&#39; and &#39;fl&#39; come out as &#39;i&#39; and &#39;l&#39; although fr, fu, fa, fo, fe, f(space) and Fi come out all right.  I suspect typing technique -- i and l are easy to type very quickly after f, while o requires the third finger on the upper level, u is less used in the language and thus perhaps less facile to type, r, a and e are also in the left hand, and Fi requires the shift key in the right hand.  OR, am I all wet and there is a perfectly reasonable other explanation for this?!!!!  Irene"
