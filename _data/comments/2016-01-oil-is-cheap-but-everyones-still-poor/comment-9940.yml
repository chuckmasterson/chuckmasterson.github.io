text: "Hm, Windows computer, Firefox... I tried the same and couldn&#39;t reproduce it. I tried messing with the magnification and that didn&#39;t turn up a problem. I&#39;ll look into this more later. If you know how to take a screenshot, could you email one to me? (If you don&#39;t, it&#39;s actually pretty simple. Hit the unpopular old PrtSc [Print Screen] button, and then open Paintbrush and hit Ctrl+V, then save it.) I think you have my email address, so I won&#39;t post it for spambots to find."
