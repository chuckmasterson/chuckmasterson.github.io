text: "Oil demand is momentarily low, but the entire world continues to industrialize. Oil demand in the long run will remain high. The world also continues to produce an emerging middle class that has an insatiable appetite for some breathing space, which will continue to spur economic demand in all consumer products, the real engine of the burgeoning global economy.<br /><br />Things seem bleak here because we still suffer from a post WWII industrial monopoly hangover and believe the life of the 1950&#39;s set a new benchmark, while in reality, it was a nirvana anomaly. We&#39;re still full of global win here, but petulant entitlement will mask the true blessings we adamantly don&#39;t see."
