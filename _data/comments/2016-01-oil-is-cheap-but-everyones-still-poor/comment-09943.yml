Wealth is not a zero sum game. The wealth of the world has increased substantially in the last 100 years. The standard of living for almost everyone has increased in some way. Monetary policy doesn&#39;t create or destroy it, it is just a tool. The global economy will probably collapse at some point, but it will quickly reboot with new or revamped currencies and monetary policies. Demand for durable goods, consumer goods, education, healthcare, services will always exist, and thus the global economy will thrive. There is plenty of oil to fuel it for at least another 100 years, and if the oil runs out, we will slowly adapt and survive."
