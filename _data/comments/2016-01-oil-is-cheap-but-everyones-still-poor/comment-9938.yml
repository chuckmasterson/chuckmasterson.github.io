text: "Actually, I see that the typist is not the problem because everything I typed in my comment has the same problem. Any f before an i or an l simply disappears.  Third finger comes through as third inger, and having a fling reads as having a ling.  It&#39;s quite amusing.  It might be an incompatibility with my server or anything else.  You&#39;ll know better than I.  Let me know if I can help in any way."
