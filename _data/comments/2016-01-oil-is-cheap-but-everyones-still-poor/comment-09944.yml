text: "Wealth <i>wasn&#39;t</i> a zero-sum game, and it still isn&#39;t <i>quite</i>, but it&#39;s getting there. And while it&#39;s true that there will likely be some oil in use for another 100 years, that oil will be getting steadily more unaffordable in real terms that whole time, because we&#39;ll be heading down the other side of the oil peak. The effect is that it&#39;ll be used in fewer and fewer places: first fewer automated factories, then fewer consumer flights, then fewer cars, until eventually only well-funded militaries can afford oil. <br /><br />When you say that demand for durable and consumer goods, education, etc. will always exist <i>and thus</i> the global economy will thrive, though, that&#39;s a large, unsupported logical leap. I think it&#39;s much more likely that only local economies will thrive—like the ones that existed before the economy globalized, in, say, the 1500s— because in a resource-limited world, the massive infrastructure needed for global shipping and interconnectivity (containerships, cargo planes, trucking fleets, fiber-optic networks, communications satellites) will be unmaintainable.<br /><br />There are a lot of different energy sources being touted as substitures for oil, but they all fall short in at least one important way, sometimes several. There&#39;s an MIT professor who undertook a long project to do the math and figure out which new energy was going to really do it for us, and he discovered, to his dismay, that none of them could really do it. Check out <a href=\"http://physics.ucsd.edu/do-the-math/2012/02/the-alternative-energy-matrix/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this sum-up of what he found</a>, and if you want more details on any of them, that blog has them all. So we will slowly adapt and survive, yes, but it won&#39;t be adaptation to a different energy source, it&#39;ll be adaptation to less total energy.<br /><br />The OECD Observer article you linked shows that the amount of oil wealth some countries have spent (not necessarily their own) has finally started paying off for some of their citizens, for now. The extrapolation they showed looks reasonable only under the assumption that world total wealth continues expanding.<br /><br />Not sure how much we actually disagree here, come to think of it, but at least a little bit on the continued growth of the middle class."
