text: "Howdy-<br/>My neighbor just had a baby boy named Nathaniel Francis, and that reminded me of you.<br/>Anywho, I started reading <i>Heart of Darkness</i> and I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT. Our \"intelligent\" English teachers have finally found a book that surpasses the genius of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. I'm on page 42 (out of 86 pages), and there is still no conflict. (What kind of crappy book allows you to read almost half of it without any conflict? What kind of exposition takes that long?) At least Holden had pretty concrete problems.  The guy in this book just keeps going down a river and bitching about how wild the wilderness is.  (Yes, that's why they call it that dumbass.) God damn this year in English is going to suck.  I hope you're in my class, maybe we'll have a little fun.<br/>Well I'm telling you this because I want you to read it and make fun of it on your site.  It'll make me feel a lot better.<br/>Tootles,<br/>Rosie<br/>PS this comment-posting thing sucks.  What kind of website doesn't recognize < u > as html?"
