text: "Nobody went to Ritchie, Dan, Tracy, Sierra Gwyneth went to saddle with success. No blueberries, too early, or better said, they are too late. Sierra Gwyneth caught a 35 inch/8 lb. pike in the final troll of the week. Think this was largest but several pike were in the 30-35 inch range. Joe lost in poker, all others were minor winners(I think) but I am the one who doesn&#39;t really count. The weather was seasonable except for Tuesday and Wednesday which were unseasonably cool, highs of around 70. Fishing was accomplished with a jacket on all day. It felt Octoberish in Cincinnati for comparison. All in all, a success.<br /><br />Dave"
