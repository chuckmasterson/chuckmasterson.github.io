text: "We missed you!  Put it on your calendar for next year.  Get your mother up there, too.  Everything was great.  North Bay was full of fish, and we had to release lots of them after we started catching them too fast.<br /><br />We swam--the lake wasn&#39;t much different from the normal temp.  But Rushing River was like ice water.  Sierra and I swam out to the big rock, which was completely submerged this year.  Grandma"
