text: "I had enough trouble getting a picture at all. I had to borrow the batteries from Kane&#39;s blipper to put in my camera, then borrow his microphone tripod to put my camera on (balanced precariously), then set the timer and get in the right position within ten seconds (and the position he&#39;s in is surprisingly hard to duplicate exactly). This is also why there are no pictures of NYC on this blog yet. In the whole time I&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve taken one, not counting the various shots I snapped trying to duplicate <i>The Desperate Young Man</i> here. <br /><br />Grandpaâ€”I&#39;m already writing a short story right now (I&#39;ve finally gotten on that task today). I bet a bunch of the people I&#39;ve met here will end up here and there in my novels, though. <br /><br />(Today I finally hit a stride in writing fiction. I never have any trouble writing in my journal or here, but up &#39;til today whenever I&#39;ve tried to write my short story I&#39;ve only seen a big blank page and produced tortured, crappy writing. But today I loosened my constraints by writing a scene that wasn&#39;t in chronological order, and it got me out of my rut. Finally!)"
