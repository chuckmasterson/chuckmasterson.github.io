text: "The effect for me here is that your first comment (12:53) was doubled. Everything else came out once.<br /><br />I&#39;ve dealt with the heat wave by drinking lots and lots of water and not moving. I&#39;ve also done a little complaining. That seems to have helped a littleâ€”it&#39;s not so hot today. I complained a couple days ago in my journal and thought I got a pretty good do on it: &quot;In a heat like this everything feels alive. When I pick up a plate it feels like it must be respiring and metabolizing secretly somehow to bring it up to body heat. The countertop is a warm-blooded creature, and so is the book I put in my bag. All the edges are blurred and being alive isn&#39;t the sort of special it usually is; cruel weather like this makes a hug useless. I packed up my things and walked through air that felt, more than ever, like the collective breath of the millions breathing in this city, up to the subway station.&quot;"
