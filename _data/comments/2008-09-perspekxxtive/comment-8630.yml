text: "Solar, wind, gravity and wave hydro, are all technologies that are renewable.  If really done right, with efficient technologies, free from politics and restrictive patenting, these sources could come close to closing the gap.<br/><br/>To say that only as few experimental technologies for non-oil cars have been made is at best ridiculous.  Tons of technologies have been developed over the years. Once they get too important, the oil companies gobble them up because they are protecting themselves. (See Chevron and NiMH batteries)  Additionally, many patents are classified security risks because they could upset our economy of oil and big business money grubbing so they never make the light of day. To actually think that viable technologies don't exist is to have your head up the butt of a politician.<br/><br/>Dan"
