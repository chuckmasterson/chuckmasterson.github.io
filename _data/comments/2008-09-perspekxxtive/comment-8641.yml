text: "Want a new topic?  Here's one.  Tomorrow I hope to get into that kitchen and bake ginger cookies for you.  That should give you some energy.  Grandpa and I are proud that we grew our own acorn squash and have a bunch of them, and we had a bumper crop of apples and made 15 pints of applesauce.  You put the two together and yummo.  And that from our little city lot.  That's our little part for sustaining the world's resources.  I'll let you know if I don't get the cookies done, so you won't stand drooling at the mail box.  Grandma"
