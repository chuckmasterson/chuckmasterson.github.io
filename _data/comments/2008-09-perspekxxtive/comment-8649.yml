text: "Wave energy ( = ocean energy, no?) can only be used close to the coast in very specific geographies, so it can't be scaled up much. Geothermal also needs a geological hot spot; Iceland could get along fine with it, and certainly Yellowstone National Park, but I'm pretty sure it can't be scaled nationwide either.<br/><br/>Now, you probably can call these blanket statements. That's because I'm not expert enough to know all the nuances of each alternative energy. That's something I'll have to do (when I can find time - I have a backlog of at least five books right now, not even including ones I'm reading for classes). But, you can't deny that at our current point in time, renewable energy has little more than a nominal place in America's economy - especially when you look at transportation. Nor can you deny that the people with the money and power to change something seem pretty uninterested in doing that so far. As peak oil becomes obvious, the economy will obviously tone up its production of renewable energy technology. But it sure looks like no one is going to bother to do much before it's obvious. The economy is reactive, not proactive. The mainstream media don't even like to mention peak oil (and at least once, a news channel - but I don't remember which, so I'd have to search out the source - admitted that they don't talk about peak oil because it's a real buzzkill, not because it's a load of crap). Call this a sweering generalization if you will, but since peak oil will happen quickly when it does (or, shift that to present tense), I'm pretty sure there won't be enough time to build up an entire new infrastructure for transportation and farming, nor will there be enough money for a quickly implemented solution - especially with the shape the global economy has descended to in the last few weeks.<br/><br/>I'm thinking your terawatts calculation is at least a little misleading. For one, subtract 2/3 for how much of the earth is ocean. Subtract another 60% because the world record solar cell efficiency (doubtless prohibitively expensive, for now at least) is 40%. Then subtract a considerable amount for cropland that you can't block out. Then subtract more for arctic areas that would get sun too obliquely, and subtract some for Seattle because the weather sucks there. Even with all that and more that I haven't thought of, there's probably a considerable margin more than we use, but it would mean covering an incredible area with solar panels. Last year someone using 50% efficiency (not far from the theoretical maximum) calculated .2% of the US land area, or the area of all paved roads in the country. And we'd need to make 2000 kmÂ² per year for 20 years to achieve it.

That's been going on since around 1958. We got to where we are right now by going At The Rate We Were Going Then. (Though it can't continue like that forever, for the reasons I talked about when I mentioned the Singularity.)"
