text: "Dan, Dan, Dan,<br/>You didn't read the article I link to. It's not by a nutjob guy. If you read his whole webpage (which I'm not asking of you - just that one section - but the whole thing isn't a bad read), you'll find he's a sane guy with well-reasoned arguments. And he lays out a pretty compelling case that the renewable technologies we have simply cannot be scaled up fast enough - not even close to fast enough - to avert what's already happening. If I'm picking between an argument backed by facts and an oil company conspiracy theory, I'll go with the one that uses facts. <br/><br/>Dave, you might be interested to know (or might already know, judging from what you said about learned people) that Chris Dodd, the Senate Banking Committee Chair, has said before the Senate that \"we may be only days away from a complete meltdown of our financial system.\" And John Boehner, House Minority Leader, said that \"this could be the most serious financial crisis that the world has ever dealt with.\""
