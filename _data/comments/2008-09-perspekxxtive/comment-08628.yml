text: "I, too, see a society that is more sustainable but that has pockets of \"technology\" and \"science\" which serve to better our health. In an ideal setting, what Dave is saying would make sense. Once all the finite stuff runs out, we will need to have sustainable societies. <br/>I'm going to send you a book by Shane Claiborne. He's a young guy probably about 30-ish. He already has an independent bunch of people who have a separate economy- grow their own cotton, make own shirts, live in own commmunities, grow own food, trade using a currency that is only meaningful to themselves. They refuse to fight or join the military. And they don't just care about themselves, but all humans, and give freely anything they have. He cites Gandhi, M.Teresa, MLK, the early Essenes, the early Christians, Jesus' REAL teachings, other examples of nonviolent resistance throughout history, the Amish, a commune in Tennessee, Wendell Berry, Jared Diamond, and on and on. He debated even publishing the book because he didn't want to use the paper and natural resources but he gave a bunch back to environmental groups.<br/>Sorry I have been late getting all these things to you. Still trying to get them all together. Love you muches and muches. <br/>Mom"
