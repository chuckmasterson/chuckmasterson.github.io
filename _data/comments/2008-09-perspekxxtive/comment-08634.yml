text: "Nat, Nat, Nat,<br/>I didn't call anyone a nutjob.  Furthermore I didn't claim that these technologies would fully close the gap and avert an energy crisis anytime soon.<br/><br/>Okay, I read the article.  It has some good information but it also made lots of subjective blanket statements that are represented as the final truth.  It also uses statistics to its advantage (see How to lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff).<br/><br/>I also saw these three HUGE problems.<br/><br/>1..Where was the question “Can further development of modern renewable energy technology become more efficient and more productive in the future?”<br/>2..Where was the question “Is it possible for renewable energy sources be used to create more renewable energy sources?”<br/>3..Nice advertisement at the end.  Hmmm wonder which way they want to skew their argument.<br/><br/>What I'm saying here is that necessity is the mother of all invention.  Go camp in the woods and be scared if you must, but I prefer to be on the part of finding answers to tough problems and not hiding from them.<br/><br/>As far as the financial market is concerned, yeah, we’re in deep $h!t.  But we also came out of the great depression.  This may be tougher than then.  The bottom line is that if you aren’t heavily invested (as you are not, as far as I know) the problem won’t affect you as much as the people that have made tons of money over the past 10-20 years.  The profits are now being shown to be false and those who made all those gains will likely now lose them.  Boo hoo.<br/><br/>Dan"
