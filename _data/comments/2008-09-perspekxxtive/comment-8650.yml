text: "I too find it interesting that peak oil is not mentioned too much in mainstream media. Peak oil for US sources was quite awhile ago. <br/><br/>Another thing I have noticed through the years all of the strip mining in eastern kentuky and west virginia. I fly over these areas alot, and I can tell you that the land is beind altered alot and on a big scale to get the coal that they are looking for. Clean coal is the next realistic player for american energy independence, and it is really going to take a toll on the land.<br/><br/>Ever get the feeling that the energy reserves we are \"harvesting\" at an alarming rate will leave a terrible legacy? It isn't a whole lot different than what we did/do with the logging industry in the last 150 years.<br/><br/>Dave"
