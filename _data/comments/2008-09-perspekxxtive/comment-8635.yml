text: "People still think I'm paranoid and a doomsayer, not the people on WallStreet, but hey anyway.<br/><br/>I recommend that everyone have some significant cash on hand. If this thing crashes like it could, you could literally go to the ATM's and they WILL NOT dispense money. This isn't doomsayer bullshit. IT is a REAL possibility. It is not running and hiding or being a doomsayer, but hedging against a real possibility.<br/><br/>People may say I'm a doomsayer, but I am also going to stock up on at least a short supply of food. If nobody gets paid, the food trucks aren't going to roll for awhile. <br/><br/>Dave"
