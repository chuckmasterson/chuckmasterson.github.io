text: "Sorry, I misspoke about the GDP. In 1980's 10% of corporate profits were from the financial services industry, and now it is 40%. 40% of the rise in your stock portfolio or 401k is based on gouging you, the consumer into borrowing money for something.<br/><br/>They are robbing us so that they can give back to us. It makes no sense and this market is gonna prove it.<br/><br/>Dave"
