text: "Hydrogen fuel cell technology is a dead end game. Read a few issues of the economist and you will see that even the proponents of hydrogen admit that it is not  realistically doable. If the compass of energy alernatives ever seriously points that way, methanol is a far better solution. There is no viable way to really produce hydrogen. There are ways to produce it using sustainable resources, but no way to produce the quantities needed for mass transit in cars that is economically feasible.<br/><br/>So far all other renewables can't produce the energy required to fuel our appetite. Cold fusion could, and it is the only real alternative so far to fossil fuels.<br/><br/>It took millions of years, or even billions to store all of the energy on this planet that we are plundering. There will probably be lots of discoveries of new oil fields, gas fields, a way to convert shale oil into gas. It will however run out. It may take 10,000 years, but it will run out. <br/><br/>All I am saying is to be careful that the american \"entitlement\" mentality does not cloud our judgement. We are not entitled to a magic bullet energy solution.<br/><br/>The way our technology has outpaced our humanity leads me to believe that we are better off without one.<br/><br/>Dave"
