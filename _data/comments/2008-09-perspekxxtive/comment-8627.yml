text: "\"Will it\" is one important question, but I'm not even so sure that it can. The reason is simple - infrastructure. As it stands, some two thirds of the oil we use go to transportation, and practically all our transportation is fueled by oil, including hybrid cars. There have only been a very few experimental designs that have run on non-oil sources, mainly hydrogen cells. Hydrogen cells, however, are very expensive, and would quickly become even more expensive if we started trying to phase them in on a large scale, because they require far and away more platinum than we have to spare. The prices as they stand now to make as many hydrogen cars as there are oil cars is I think more than the world's total GDP. It would be decades before we could have anything even close to widespread hydrogen cars - and by then it'd be too late, since we'd be out of oil. Solar similarly would require a complete redesign of the workings of cars, and would be cost-prohibitive. The main problems with renewable energies are that they're too expensive still, and that it would take too long to phase them in in a way that would significantly affect the economy. To find a guy who covers this a lot more knowledgeably than I could, go <a href=\"http://www.lifeaftertheoilcrash.net/SecondPage.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and read the section titled \"What about green alternatives like solar, wind, wave, and geothermal?\""
