text: "Okay, guys. Sorry I haven't been giving any comprehensive sorts of responses. Dan, as for your HUGE problem #1, he mentions that solar power has made massive increases in affordability and efficiency, and costs 5% of what it did a few years ago, but yet it still has a growth rate of 10% per year, and that's not enough to take over the electricity market. The answer is, yes it's possible to keep refining alternative energy methods so they become more efficient, but at the rate we're going, it'll soon become moot. I think I did the calculation somewhere else here - if solar contitues at its current growth rate, it'll be 60 years before even half the US's electricity comes from solar. If I recall correctly, the other alternative sources suffer the same problems, or more crippling ones (hydro, for example, suffers the problem that we can't really viably dam any more rivers than we already have).<br/>For HUGE problem #2, whether alternative energies can be used to develop alternative energies, the answer is yes, but they won't until renewable energy powers most of the grid and cars. Until then, they'll keep using oil and coal. Well, unless they run out and have no choice, but then it will have become too late.<br/>And for your HUGE problem #3, well, at least he doesn't hide that he's affiliated with Nitro-Pak. I think, though, that he probably linked to that <i>after</i> he had had the site and the arguments up for a while. I doubt he's being paid off by Nitro-Pak. And, his affiliations don't affect his arguments - you still have to attack those instead of the ads.<br/><br/>The reason I said he's not a nutjob isn't that I thought you said he was, but that I thought you might have dismissed it before reading it as about Peak Oil and therefore probably written by a nutjob. I guess you just hadn't read it.<br/><br/>My position on McCain and Obama? Well, any president is going to continue destroying the environment, but Obama will destroy it appreciably slower than McCain, so I'm for Obama.<br/><br/>I'm going to write a new blog sometime soon. Maybe today or tomorrow."
