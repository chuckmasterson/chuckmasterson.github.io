text: "Not buying the oil company conspiracy. Money grubbing is too powerful to keep in a bottle. If there is a way to market it and make money, the money grubbers will make it happen.(See wall street). Did you know that in the 1980's financial services made up 10% of the GDP, but now it accounts for 40% of the GDP? Funny money and credit mania. I was watching the news tonight and they said that last thursday the financial industry was within hours of total collapse. Money was being pulled out of everything, and for the first time last week, money markets actually lost money. The funny thing is that this mess could literally turn into 1929 overnight, espeically if the world doesn't buy our govt. bailout IOU's. The tension on Wall street could be likened to the Cuban missile crisis, but stupid america is not too concerned. Very learned people are VERY concerned right now. It like watching a movie of a nuclear powerplant meltdown. The top scientests know the gravity of the situation as it leads up to crisis, while the masses of other stiffs in the plant don't have a clue.<br/><br/>Dave"
