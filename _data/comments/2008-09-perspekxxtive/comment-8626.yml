text: "No relief for fossil fuels?  That is unrealistic.  There are many technologies already available to end our dependence on fossil fuels.  The problem is political and greed driven. Duh.  Until people realize that we as a civilization have to shift from fossil fuels to other energy sources, we won't make any progress.  The main hurdle to overcome is the infrastructure problem.  That hurdle CAN be jumped, but WILL IT is the real question.<br/><br/>Dan"
