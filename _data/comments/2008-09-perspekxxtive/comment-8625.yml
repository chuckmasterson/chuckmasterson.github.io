text: "I believe that the two could co-exist in the future. The far off future anyway. This gets to a root technology question of travelling at or above the speed of light. Bear with me. I envision a fossil fuel endgame that by comparison to our lifespan is way out there. I'm thinking 2000 years or so. Technology advances and fossil fuels including coal will eventually disappear. Barring the miracle of cold fusion, there is nothing on the horizon as a magical energy source in a 2000 year time period. You never know where science is going, but I for one don't believe in the parabolic rise of technology.<br/><br/>Look at the diseases we have cured. None in the last 50 years or so. Look at the diseases we eradicated at the turn of the century. Science is so more advanced today, but after a few \"easy\" discoveries, we are basically stumped in science as it realtes to 100% cures of disease. We have vastly improved cancer treatments that appraoch a cure, but they center around better ways to remove what is there as opposed to curing it.<br/><br/>I think the same applies to cold fusion, speed of light travel and other things along these lines. I believe it is more likely that there will not be a magical technical cure to fossil fuel extinction. This will result in a society that de-evolves into a sustainable 1800's type of existence. There could be islands, or oaisis' of medical treatment centers interspersed in a de-evolved society. It would be a highly enlightend and educated soceiety, but one that lives a sustainable simplified life. Energy would be concentrated in technology centers that would mostly focus on medical treatment.<br/><br/>You and your buddy could plan the future of the world!<br/><br/>This is an out there guess, but if I had to put money on it, I would bet the world looks like this in 2000+ years...<br/><br/><br/>Dave"
