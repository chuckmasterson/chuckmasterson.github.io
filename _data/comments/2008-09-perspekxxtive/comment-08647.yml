text: "I still have problems with your argument that it will soon become moot, and it's too late, etc.  These are ridiculous blanket statements that I’m surprised you would make so haphazardly.  I agree that at the rate we are developing these technologies now, you're right it would take way too long.  The problem is, very little is being spent on these technologies.  If more investment was applied, coupled with a greater sense of urgency and need, the technology would likely grow at a much faster pace than now.  I can’t stand it when people say “at the rate we’re _______ now,” it is usually a meaningless statement.  Just think about computer technology over the past 20 or 30 years, if that technology still moved at the rate it did in the 70’s you’d still be using 5-1/4” floppy’s and no hard drives would exist. <br/><br/>You also didn't address wave energy or ocean energy.  This is relatively new technology that has just begun to scratch the surface and could have huge potential. Not to mention geothermal, which I apparently left out before.<br/><br/><br/>Now down to the basic numbers:<br/>Our sun produces 386 billion billion megawatts (Both billions are there on purpose).  Earth catches approximately 32,485,000 terawatts per year.  We currently use 140,000 terawatts per year.  That's a big gap.  I'm not saying that it would be easy, but there is obviously potential for solar energy to fill the gap if you look at the simple numbers."
