text: "You have figured out rule #1 of life.  No one's going to take care of you but yourself, so you will need to work.  And the trick is to find work where you don't feel that you're selling yourself, but enriching something--the world, children, the environment, animals, or maybe yourself.  My dad used to say that the key to his happiness was working for himself.  That is, he was part owner of the company so anything that benefitted the company benefitted him, too.  Hope you get the summer Wisconsin job because I'll bet you'll love it and they will love you, too.  Grandma"
