text: "Crowduck is like heaven! The staff is unbelievable, and so is the fishing! I don't think its possible for anyone to not fall in love and never want to leave. I just got back from there a couple days ago and its depressing. I would love nothing more than to stay there all summer long! Hopefully the year will pass quite fast and before I know it I will be back in my \"heaven\"!!!"
