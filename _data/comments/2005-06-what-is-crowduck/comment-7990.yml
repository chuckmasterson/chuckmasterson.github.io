text: "Hi Chuck:  If you feel that way about Crow Duck then  <br/>you feel exactly the way I feel about it.  I feel I have done my job as a Grandpa, i.e., provided you with a taste of nature and wilderness that one cannot find locally and will never lose once they have  experienced it. It will be another great year at Crow Duck.  \"Fish On\"    Grandpa"
