text: "Chippewa is actually just another name for the same language. And another name for it is Anishinaabe/Anishinaabemowin. (I hear a lot of people call it \"Ojibwe\" when they're speaking English, but \"Anishinaabemowin\" when they're speaking Ojibwe.)\r\n\r\n\"Giizis\" simply means sun or moon. (Sun is the default meaning; to make it unambiguous that you're talking about the moon, you'd say \"dibiki-giizis\" or \"night sun\".)\r\n\r\nWikipedia says it's polysynthetic; I might tend more toward agglutinative, but that's based on just now refreshing myself on what all those distinctions actually are. The gloss of the title is:\r\n\r\nInd- | izhaa | iwidi |iskigamizi- | -gan | -ing  \r\n1SG | go | over there | boil down | NOMINALIZER | LOC\r\n{: .gloss }\r\n\r\nWhere “iskigamiz-” is a dependent form (an independent form is \"iskigamizan\", where the \"-an\" makes it transitive-to-an-inanimate-object), made of:\r\n\r\niski- | -gam- | -iz-  \r\nlower liquid level | liquid | act on by heat\r\n{: .gloss }\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm going to copy these over to blog comments. Facebook comments won't be a thing for this blog much longer - see my other recent status."
