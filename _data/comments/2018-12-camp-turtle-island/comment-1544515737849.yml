No sense being purist, the stuff’s out there, just make good use of it\"\r\n\r\nI still remember you wrote something about post industralization before, didnt you? People invented many things which actually it create problem in the end. For Indonesian, back when we were Dutch East Hindia , people walk and ride a bike. But now, there is a survey that revealed Indonesian (mostly capital people) walk rarely in their daily life (Thats why then the goverment makes a car free day in some places every sunday). The logic works in another case too. Before, people didnt even touch the forest cause they believe supersition that something is there. Now we opened the forest, mostly for the palm plantation and it damages the orang utan and indigeneous ethnics. Even the goverment promotes sustainable palm oil industry but till today could not trust it. Banning palm oil will only increase the number of poor people, they said. And what most people are bragging a lot now? plastics in the ocean. Recently a whale was found death in one Indonesian's beach with a belly full of plastics. While one local goverment ban the plastic usage , the association of plastic industry prosted it cause the gov should not ban it, instead they can promote people to use the degredable one. Decreasing the plastic usage will make people in plastic industry lose their job. Basically, if people choose traditional way, Indonesian society can use less plastic.. but again how bout life of people in the plastic industry?"
