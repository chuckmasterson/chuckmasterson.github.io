text: "Form follows function, and humans follow the path of least resistance. We all have a thirst for something more, something outside of ourselves. For me, I found marathon running. It takes you to a place with yourself that few will ever get to. You find limits, break limits, anguish, euphoria, heartbreak, and pure joy, all in 26.2 miles. But after those few hours are over, I want a cold drink, warm meal, soft bed and climate controlled living space. We can’t live on the edge for more than a short period of time. To think that the world will voluntarily devolve, the way it eventually will is nothing more than a dream.\r\n\r\nYou’re pushing your boundaries and finding the edge, I think that’s great. But I don’t think you’ll ever find community living in this manner voluntarily. You’re anecdotal sampling over the various players seems to back that up. You’ve won a lottery ticket. You get to be a bombastic resource exploiter. All things have a cycle and we are stuck in the period we were born into. I think your visions of the future are correct. Someday in the future resources will be scant, and nobody will be living in space. If anything altruistic is happening, it is this- our energy hoarding lifestyle is certainly producing technological fruit that future generations won’t be able to produce. Perhaps the iPhone 20 and it’s associated technology will be seen as the equivalent of Greek philosophy or Roman law one day. Both were cultural high points that keep on giving to the future. Certainly we are producing similar fruit."
