  Super stories and accounts, Nathanael. It's great to hear from you! Sounds
  like a place that suits  you well, and not without some of the difficulties of
  all places. Hobo level 5 (out of 5)? Is anywhere perfect? I think not... but
  when we let our paths (paves?, with a short A? nah just trying it out hehe)
  lead us, or our heart settle into where we are or are brought to, we accept
  the imperfections and decide to work towards the world/place/community we want
  to see. And a work in progress, always. (Practice for life. Chronic!! Terminal
  striving whilst perpectually letting go) Annnddd some folks say home is where
  the heart is, and wherever we go we carry the light of our selves and nestle
  into the present as if we've always been there (OK I just made up that last
  bit)... so whenever you or I or we or one goes, treat it as if it could be
  home... or not, and enjoy it and leave at the end of the day, thankful for
  fire or light or food or company. Contradicting and vague statements aside,
  miss ya and am glad to see what you've been up to. Thanks for sharing your
  experiences, giving us all a taste of what we miss and get through others.
  Much love- Kd (PS. I AM NOT A ROBOT... I am a bi-borg)
