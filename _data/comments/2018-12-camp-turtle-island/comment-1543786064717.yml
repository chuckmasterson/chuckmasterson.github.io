text: "I agree that people aren't going to stop being profligate until they have to---that's something I've been discovering during my travels. What's interesting to me is places where they *do* have to. Wherever people are poor, because they've been locked out of the global game of money flow, you find that community starting to rebuild itself (if it ever disappeared). That's what I see tentatively starting at Camp Turtle Island. They don't have a lot of money on the rez; never have. So they have to work together to get by day to day.\r\n\r\nI guess where the interesting part lies, to me, is that as time goes by, more and more people are going to need to know how to rely on each other rather than the big system---but they might not have any clue how to go about it until it's almost too late for them, depending on how suddenly things change in their life situation. And ideas that are useful might get lost in the jarring transition, or not get spread from where they were invented to where they're needed. So a way to do good in these times is to help people see what's coming, know how to adapt to it, and spread their ideas among each other."
