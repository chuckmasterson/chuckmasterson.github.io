text: "Yeah, maybe you could define perfection as the act of striving for perfection. Like the *Tao Te Ching* says, \"The greatest perfection appears imperfect.\" I think that's why I'm leaning toward spending the rest of the winter there to see where it goes. If I give up on the place because no one stays, I'm part of the problem\\* because I didn't stay, but if I give it a real try, try to let it be home, be part of the possibility of a solution and a future... something may come of it. And if it becomes clear it won't, well, I probably wasn't missing much in Ashland anyhow over the winter, and I can move there later.\r\n\r\nMiss you too. Thanks for checking in, it's nice to hear you, it's like there's a little sunny spot I can see all the way through the internet where you peeked in.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\\*Yogi Berra's words seem strangely relevant---\"Nobody goes there anymore, it's too crowded.\""
