text: "Wonderful thing about college.  Even if I don't talk to people on AIM, there's always these wee hours of the night to express myself when you are tucked snuggly into bed.<br/><br/>I can't help but laugh about the PAC rededication. Makes me feel a bit guilty that I recommended that you go.  Oh well.<br/><br/>Congratulations on your snow day.  Less than 24 hours after the snow hit Cincinnati, a system went through Boston that left a solid foot on the ground.  A friend of mine took pictures, and I will of course share them when I have harassed her into putting them online.<br/><br/>Ubercongratulations on the 99th percentile.  That fiend escaped me twice.  But the real question is, what are you going to do with it? Have you started sorting the menagerie of college letters?<br/><br/>My embedded reporter told me about your matches, and it is encouraging that you are losing by less and less every time.  A third congratulations on being nominated as MVP.<br/><br/>Sounds like besides your aunt, things are going rather well with you.  I'll be home for 3+ weeks starting on the 23rd, and we need to get together so I can harangue you and you can politely ignore me, as usual.<br/><br/>Much affection<br/>Freezing Far East (If you're from the Midwest, you might as well be a) Foreigner"
