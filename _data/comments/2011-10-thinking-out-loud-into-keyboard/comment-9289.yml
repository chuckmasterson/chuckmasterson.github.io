text: "Chuck and I spent one day in Vietnam in 1995 when we were on a cruise of the South China Sea.  We docked in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) and were taken on a bus ride to the Mekong Delta, where we had a fascinating fish lunch in an outdoor cabana.  Later we went on another boat to a spot where we were served some native fruit.  One of the fruits was called dragon fruit, and I have been enamored of it ever since.  Outside is a rosy red roughly pear-shaped skin (non-edible) covering a white flesh filled with tiny black seeds throughout.  The taste resembles kiwi, as best as I can describe it.  I&#39;ve read it&#39;s native to Central America, but we never saw it there, only in Vietnam and southern China.  Look for it, and have some for me!<br /><br />Aunt E."
