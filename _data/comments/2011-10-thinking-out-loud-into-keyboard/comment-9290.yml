We should definitely figure out the video chat thing for Christmas, though.<br /><br />They actually have dragonfruit at this huge international market called Jungle Jim&#39;s a little north of Cincinnati. I had one and it was quite an experienceâ€”I bet they&#39;re even better when they&#39;re fresh and local."
