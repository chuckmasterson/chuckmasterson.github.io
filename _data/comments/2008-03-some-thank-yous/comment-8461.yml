text: "I am happy to hear things are going better.  I did look in a couple times.<br/><br/>My son is a year older than you and he had a similarly rough time his first semester at Madison.  He is doing well now, but moving away from home triggered a lot of questions that he had not realized were simmering below the surface.  We had been much more worried when his sister left for Galesburg two years earlier but she hit the ground running despite struggling more in high school.  As Yul Brynner said in <i>The King and I</i>, “Is a puzzlement.”<br/><br/>I’m glad to know that I did not overreach.  I was wary about sticking my two cents in, but I thought I might have a useful insight or two (even if they had been found purely through trial and error)."
