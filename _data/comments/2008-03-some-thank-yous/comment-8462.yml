text: "We are glad you enjoyed the ribs, but wish you'd have finished them off so I wouldn't have any to eat for lunch the next day.  Ha.  Grandpa was a bit surprised that the whole cake was eaten, but he was glad you ate it so he wouldn't have anything to nibble on later, either.  And if Grinnell food is anything like Drake food was in the 50's, you'll half starve before summer, so treat yourself to a Maid-Rite or two and think of us.  Love, Grandma"
