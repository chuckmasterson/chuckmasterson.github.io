text: "Boy, it's a good thing we didn't try to stop and see you last week, with the horrible time you were having.  We'd have been in the way for sure.  We passed Grinnell on Thursday morning and are now in Arizona for the winter.<br/><br/>It's amazing to think you are planning your \"junior\" year abroad.  Sure hope you have fun making your decisions.<br/><br/>Aunt E."
