text: "It was for a project in unobtrusive observation. I stood around and watched shoppers go past.<br/>Forgot to mention that on the way back, James and I cut through a field that was growing with clover, presumably to put nitrogen back in the soil.<br/><br/>Galapagos: Ooh! Ooh! One of those huge tortoises! Bring me one of those! But really, I'm sure anything you bring back from any of those three terrific places will be excellent. I wish I were going with you - I didn't know you were going on such an interesting trip this year.<br/><br/>P.S. Do we know what week Crowduck is going to be yet, or does that information come around Christmastime?"
