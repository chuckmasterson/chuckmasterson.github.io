text: "Well, the thing is that I am one of those people with no self-control. If there&#39;s one thing that I&#39;ve proved to myself repeatedly over the last five years or so, it&#39;s that when I&#39;m on the computer it&#39;s next to impossible for me to keep myself from wasting time. I think it&#39;s best for me to keep the computer off and closed and out of my mind so I don&#39;t even get tempted. I&#39;ve worked out before that my relation with the internet has all the psychological hallmarks of an addiction and I could probably get it diagnosed if I thought there was any point to that.<br /><br />But would I want to get rid of computers entirely, so they couldn&#39;t be used even in moderation? Which is to say, would I want the future to look like the past, if that were possible? (Nod to Grandma and Grandpa here.) It&#39;s really hard to say, and a complex question, and I started to answer it here, but realized I was beginning to write a whole other blog. So I guess I&#39;ll just keep that subject in my pocket for a later installment here. <br /><br />P.S. From what I remember from years back when I read one of her books, Jean Auel is silly."
