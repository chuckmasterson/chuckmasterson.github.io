text: "Old philosopher&#39;s wife say keep up the passions, whatever they are.  I read Jean Auel and love looking back.  She&#39;s a bit fanciful in certain departments, but still brings the stone age to life.  If, however, you do go sans computer, please don&#39;t let it get you out of touch with the people who care about you, like old philosopher and wife."
