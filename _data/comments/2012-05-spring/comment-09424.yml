text: "I enjoyed reading this-- thanks for chaining yourself to the computer long enough to share!<br /><br />I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about how computers are used and have to agree that for me (and most people), the majority of time spent behind screens is wasted. I&#39;ve been free from my lame data entry job for almost two months now, but still spend a good part of the day behind a computer. Granted, I&#39;ve taken on two other projects that require it, but still... sometimes I wish I could just break away, like you say.<br /><br />But I&#39;ve also been reading a lot lately. One of the more inspiring books in recent memory is &quot;Emotional Design&quot;-- it discusses how products, anything from orange juicers to PCs, interact with our emotions. One of the later chapters is dedicated entirely to robots, and how they will need to be designed with emotion in mind.<br /><br />This got me thinking-- suppose we could have computers that acted in an emotional way in order to keep us from wasting too much time? I&#39;m not talking about productivity software-- more like an OS that could &#39;read&#39; your emotions/needs and nudge you accordingly, like a good friend. Think about it."
