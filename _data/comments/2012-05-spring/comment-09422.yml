text: "Another great blog Nathanael.<br /><br />I tend to think that everything in moderation is (within reason) fair game. I also tend to think that those people who deliberately deprive themselves are actually the people who have no real self control. If you can use a computer for doing important, life enhancing and creative things and don&#39;t use it for procrastinating and wasting time then I see no reason for giving it up. Surly it&#39;s the user that is the problem and not the computer itself. It is the user who decides how to use the technology. <br /><br />From what I&#39;ve read and from what I&#39;ve seen, you are using this technology for the purpose of being creative, insightful and productive. Maybe just cut out those humor sites... just keep writing blogs."
