text: "I am also currently in a stage of revolt of current affairs and am engrossed in reading many books, mostly the older the better. The other day I came to a conclusion that whatever your philosophy is, it is lacking in this day and age and most everyone these days could do with revisiting an era, any era where men and women stood for anything other than materialism, sloth, or gluttony. I really enjoy reading the more refreshing minds of the eras that have passed. My latest bent is St. Augustine. Startling parallels between Rome of about 400AD and the bridge we find ourselves at now. I ditched my facebook to finding it to be nothing but a waste of time. Maybe I&#39;ll start a blog again to talk with family without all of the facebook bullshittery.<br /><br />I say back....back to the future!<br /><br />Dave"
