text: "Wine&#39;s paleo, and lard is extremely paleo. Most versions of paleo also allow for occasional cheat foods, the idea being that so long as you&#39;re generally adhering, you can go ahead and live it up now and then with minimal ill effects. Mostly, though, people report that it doesn&#39;t feel nearly as much like a deprivation as you might think, because you actually end up feeling freed of a lot of foods that tend to make you hungrier or awaken bad cravings. Sweets make you want more sweets, but if you don&#39;t eat any, you end up not even thinking about them.<br /><br />But I see what you&#39;re saying, and everyone&#39;s got to find their own balance between healthy eating and what-I-really-want eating. For me, since I like to cook and since I think healthy food tastes awesome, I&#39;m sliding it over far to the healthy end. I think most people could slide it that way too with a lot less inconvenience than they imagine, but I can&#39;t make that decision, and I can&#39;t determine what anyone else&#39;s quality of life really is for them."
