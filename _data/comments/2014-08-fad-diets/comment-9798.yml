text: "Well at the risk of sounding fatalistic, I don&#39;t really care. That&#39;s not really it though. I see it more along the lines of John MacArthur; ie, it&#39;s a spiritual problem manifesting itself in the western world&#39;s obsession with anything that lengthens your life. Can you lengthen life by ten years? Perhaps. The never ending chase for the &#39;correct&#39; formula for living life is a futile one.<br /><br />Dave"
