text: "For what it&#39;s worth, paleo also aims to take out those other foods that your body converts into sugar, like potatoes and bread.<br /><br />There are people making money off paleo, but they&#39;re mostly pretty benign. They&#39;re selling information (books where they comb the scientific journals so you don&#39;t have to), and in the worst cases supplements (to replace, they argue, the nutrients that would be in our vegetables and meat if we were still able to get them from the wild). There are some companies selling paleo snacks but they&#39;re still tiny mail-order things. Paleo is more about cooking for yourself than most other diets, so it&#39;s not too well suited to commercialization. <br /><br />And I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware, but not eating sugar isn&#39;t the same as not eating anything. There&#39;s actually been research that&#39;s found that, of the three macronutrients in the human diet (fat, protein, carbs), carbs are the only one where there&#39;s no necessary minimum intake. You can thrive indefinitely on zero carbs (or as close to zero as practically possible), and people do."
