text: "I&#39;m going back to my genetically pre-programmed diet. The German diet. Red meat, sausage, a smattering of vinegary vegetables, and beer!  It&#39;s proven and probably close to being Paleo.<br /><br />I&#39;m fighting back! We live in a world where trashing liberty and the constitution are celebrated but littering brands you a pariah. So grab some brats, sauerkraut, beer, and leave a big mess behind ;-)<br /><br />Dave"
