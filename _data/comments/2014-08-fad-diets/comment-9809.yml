text: "I suspect it&#39;s more what you ate as a growing child and adolescent that determines your dietary needs than what your distant ancestors ate regularly, however healthy. Just don&#39;t ask me to eat Schwartzsour, however you spell it. <br /><br />I still maintain that it&#39;s true what my dietician friends said, which was that for the best health, &quot;eat a variety of foods.&quot;  That was their best advice. <br /><br />Irene"
