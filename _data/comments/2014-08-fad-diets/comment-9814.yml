Fried cinnamon rolls and eggs for breakfast,  Bacon, lettuce and tomato on toasted whole wheat bread, with a side of tater salad for lunch and chicken fried round steak, mashed potatoes and whole milk gravy, with green Beas for dinner.  Screw it, I&#39;m 77 and will do what I want.  I call it living."
