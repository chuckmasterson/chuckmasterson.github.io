text: "Schwartzsauer is our family heritage.  Cooked blood and dumplings.  My mom made this nasty stuff once in a while and she actually liked it.  It was black and stinky and I wouldn&#39;t touch it with a ten foot pole.  Then or today, for that matter.  I once asked one of my students who was from Germany (exchange student) if she&#39;d heard of it and she had not.  Apparently they&#39;re in the 21st century in Germany, too.  Ha.   Grandma"
