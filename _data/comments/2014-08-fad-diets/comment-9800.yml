text: "I would much rather live an imperfect life and die younger--who needs to be very old, anyway.  Old age is tough, and highly overrated.<br /><br />So I&#39;ll eat my occasional doughnut, drink my glass of wine, stay addicted to sweets, and die happy but younger.  It&#39;s no one&#39;s business but my own.  <br />But if it makes your life better to go paleo, I support you 100% and will cook paleo for you whenever you are here.  I love learning new cooking styles, anyway.  <br /><br />If you come to Crow Duck, though, bring your own paleo things so we don&#39;t have another experience of running out of paleo foods.  <br /><br />Grandma"
