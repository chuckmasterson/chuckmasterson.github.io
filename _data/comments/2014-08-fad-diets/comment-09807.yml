text: "You&#39;re right, I shouldn&#39;t underestimate people&#39;s ability to commercialize stuff. But it does have an undercurrent of independence to it that I don&#39;t see in diets like low-fat or even vegan. (Vegans cook their own food plenty, but they&#39;re also, in my experience, suckers for vegan baked goods.) I feel like that&#39;s likely to stick around and make commercializing the diet somewhat tougher even if it does get popular enough for it to be worthwhile. <br /><br />It&#39;s sort of like pot, actually. Everyone gets pot from their local supplier or grower or whoever because you can&#39;t get it commercially. Except now you can in some places, but the existing dealers are still doing plenty of business, not just the weed shops. It&#39;s still connected to the rebel spirit, even if the connection might weaken.<br /><br />Far be it from me to contradict anything you know about gout after living with someone who had it, but I am going to copy in what I found in that same <i>Perfect Health Diet</i> book about it:<br /><br />“The first step in fructose detoxification is its conversion to fructose-1-phosphate. The phosphate is drawn from the energy molecule ATP (adenosine triphosphate), creating a shortage of phosphate and excess of adenosine. The adenosine is disposed of by conversion to uric acid, which is released to the blood. High levels of fructose consumption beget high levels of uric acid. <br /><br />“This is problematic because humans, along with dogs and apes, are the only species lacking the enzyme uricase, which breaks down uric acid. High fructose intake therefore leads to an accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints, causing intense pain, a condition called gout. People with impaired fructose metabolism get gout at a high rate.”<br /><br />I have no idea if that process sounds familiar, and perhaps there are other pathways for gout to develop. <br /><br />Inuits, incidentally, traditionally ate basically nothing but red meat and fish, though no red wine, and they had negligible rates of chronic diseases like gout and cancer and such."
