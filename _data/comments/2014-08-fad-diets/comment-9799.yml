text: "The length of life is only one  aspect of living.  One&#39;s personal take on quality of life is, in my opinion, much more important.  A long miserable life without anti Paleo foods would indeed be long and miserable.  My father ate anything he wanted, including lard and he lived a long life on his terms.   And that&#39;s the point, live life on your own terms and let others do the same."
