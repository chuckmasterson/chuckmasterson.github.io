text: "All of that but the green Beas, please.  Are they jealous or seasick?<br />Mom didn&#39;t make the schwartzsauer herself, she got it from the butcher.  He used to make it every now and then and he&#39;d tell her about it so she could buy some.  He was a real butcher in a real &#39;butcher shop&#39; and you sure don&#39;t see that around any more.  Mom&#39;s family ate it on the farm, apparently, but I don&#39;t know who made it for them. She used to tell how embarrassed they were one night when somebody important, like the minister, showed up just as they were finishing off dinner and their mouths were all black. <br />I might be willing to try it now, I&#39;m a little less fastidious than I was.  What put me off was that black color, which was visibly contrasted against those big white dumplings, as much as the vinegary smell and the liquid consistency.<br />Irene"
