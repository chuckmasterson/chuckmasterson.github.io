Watch as people scramble to make the bucks off the paleo diet too.  <br /><br />Doughnuts, or the equivalent, have been around for a long time, including before the industrial revolution.  <br /><br />If I don&#39;t eat any sweets, I DO think about them.  It&#39;s too late for me. If you don&#39;t eat anything at all, you DO feel hungry, and you do have to eat something. <br /><br />I know a woman who gave up sugar for quite a while, and she never lost a pound.  Your body converts other foods into sugar anyway.  It just takes a little longer to digest them, so maybe you don&#39;t feel as hungry as quickly afterwards.<br /><br />And I fully agree that common sense should rule.<br /><br />Irene"
