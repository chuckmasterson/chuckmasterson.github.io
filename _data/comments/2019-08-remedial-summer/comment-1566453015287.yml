  Whoops, I got some of my figures on size from a website from 2007 where a guy
  was lamenting that it was about to be torn down, and then that year got stuck
  in my head. Fixed now. I wish I could've seen it. Even just the footing makes
  me feel like I've wandered into a land peopled by giants.
