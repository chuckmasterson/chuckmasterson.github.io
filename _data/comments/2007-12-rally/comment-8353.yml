text: "Ok, time for my opinion on politics. This is a crystallized version.<br/><br/>Rome is burning, to some degree at least.<br/><br/>Most don't see it, or care, proven in voter apathy.<br/><br/>Nothing will change SUBSTANTIALLY until at least 80% of people vote, ALL of the time....or there is an entire collapse of the economy, or more specifically the american consumer. I believe it to be near.<br/><br/>Brand X and Y are too similar, and nobody votes via conscience, because that has been sold to USA inc., lobbyists, intrest groups, etc. You already know what all of the candidates will do. It depends who gave the most.<br/><br/>Subatance is gone, style is all that is left. Style ala Reagan or Kennedy, the ability to lead via inspiration is more powerful than gridlock.<br/><br/>I believe two candidates have this potential. Obama and Rudy.<br/><br/>Dont' mistake this for pessimism, it actually gives me hope!<br/><br/>This country needs real change, and it's coming.<br/><br/>Dave"
