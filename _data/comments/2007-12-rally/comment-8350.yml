I have heard some things about him but can't validate much. From what I can tell, though, I don't see that he has much experience or practical know-how in how to deal with Iraq. But I can go with a candidate starting from- will they respect life and cultivate a sense of value of it? The fact that there are 6.5 billion of us now should not negate the value of even one of us. In other words, each person is as valuable in a world of 6.5 billion as they would be in a world of 1000. There is too much of a mercantilistic value put on a human being, and I believe as human beings we are of infinite value and thereful can't be quantified in terms of numbers or contribution to the GNP or how much one individual contributes to society financially or socially or in any way. So there, then, is what I say. I must say I have not been entirely impressed with any of the leading contenders. They say Huckaby is up there now in Iowa and he was on the back burner until recently. To be fair, I would try to get to see at least one of the Republicans. <br/><br/>I can go with low taxes or high taxes as long as it's a system that WORKS. If I'm taxed out the wazoo, I want to know that my money is going for a cause that I believe in- build roads, make good schools, don't give it to lobby groups...make it worth it.  So far, though, under Democrats, I have seen a lot of MY money squandered. Bush gave me a more sizeable chunk of my money back. Not that he hasn't wasted money, too. <br/><br/>The whole hate-Bush thing, I'm old enough now that I can tell you that when I was in college it was EXACTLY the same, with the liberals and the demos hating Reagan, another 2-term president. They criticized his economic plan, trickle-down theory, etc. All the pundits were out talking about it just the same as today. <br/><br/>\"Ray-gun is too old to run.\" <br/><br/>I remember students putting graffiti everywhere, etc. When I was in Colombia EVERYONE was railing against Reagan. <br/>Everyone thought he'd get us into a nuclear war. There was this whole thing going on in Libya and people thought he was a huge warmonger and insincere and just a good ol' boy. Heck I didn't and still do not agree with the bombing in Tripoli. <br/>Then he helped bring down the wall. <br/>Then legend grew and it became bigger than himself, as years later people reminisced about \"The Reagan Years\" and \"Reaganomics\". <br/>I believe something similar will happen to Bush. In a liberal college you are unlikely to hear anything positive about him, and I know that, especially since I was in a college not known for liberalism and I still heard it all the time against Reagan. The best thing is to look behind the spin for ANY politician and in Bush's case, behind his annoying way of talking (seems he is always chiding whoever asks him a question, but it's his mannerisms that really bother people though they don't know it- he is awful at public speaking and needs to take a Toastmaster's class). <br/><br/>Try to ignore the spin and see what a candidate is really about. <br/><br/>IMHO- <br/><br/><br/>MOM"
