I've been watching all the candidates and have seen no one, either party, who has his freshness and candor.  But he's got an uphill battle trying to wrest the nomination from Hillary.  Hope he can do it.  Hope you are not studying too hard, but I know you have a lot on your plate right now.  Grandma"
