  Aaaaw this post made me cry - just a little happy-meloncholy cry.  So proud to
  see you head out and to hear the appreciation for the community that you have
  been a part of building here.  Cheers to you knowing that nature calls and
  recognizing that you will ALWAYS be welcome back to Minneapolis.  We've had
  many good times here, but your destiny has in store many more out in the
  greater world :) Happy trails - go soak up the wild!
