text: "The bad news: Our two kittens ran away despite our best efforts to pen them. <br/>Other bad news: Bandit (the ex Miss Weasel) stockpiles shoes, watches, cookies, shiny objects, utensils of all sorts, and just about anything else, so be prepared to be robbed. You may be able to locate said items under the stove, behind the washer, in the downstairs shower (along with other \"gifts\" she leaves in that particular location), and in various corners and hidey holes throughout the house. Be prepared for an \"I didn't do it\" look before being bitten. Oh, and she also teases Tommy something silly.<br/><br/>I miss the kittens. We made them well and got them clean and happy, and they'd try try try to run out the door. At first we'd let them but neighbors kept bringing them back. Then we said no kittens out, period. So we'd shut the door and they'd try to slip out anyways underfoot, and they finally succeeded. First it was Trixie, and then Lily about a week later. I looked EVERYWHERE for those cats. I mean I went all sorts of places I thought clueless kittens would go. My hunch is the neighbor's akita that bit Micah ON OUR PROPERTY (Micah was trying to pet it) may have eaten them...I don't like akitas...really I don't...nasty dogs. I hope I'm wrong and that someone found those kittens and took them in. Really I do. I wanted my callies! Did I mention I dislike akitas. I DO NOT LIKE AKITAS. Mean and vicious dogs. <br/>We can fix maid-rites when you're here.<br/>Please call and let me know when you are on the way. Call me at work if necessary. Whenever you are about to go. PLEASE. I don't care what time it is. If we don't answer, leave a message. I love you and God bless. -Mom"
