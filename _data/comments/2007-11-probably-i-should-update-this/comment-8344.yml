text: "Don't worry about the gifts.  You'll still get some from some people, and Joe's not going to be here, nor are Dan and Tracy so it'll be quieter already.  But it is tough sometimes letting go of the magic of Christmas when you take on more of the responsibilities of it.  Sometimes growing up is a bummer.  I will play Scrabble with you again.  By the way, send me a little Santa Claus letter one of these days, the way you used to do.  It'll help.  Love, Grandma"
