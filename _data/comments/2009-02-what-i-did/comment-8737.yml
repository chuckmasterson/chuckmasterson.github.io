text: "Yes, your moai looks very real.  (Well, excluding the color!)  Did you know all the real moai on Rapa Nui (their word for their island) were knocked down by infighting among the natives?  They had to be restored to their upright positions by volunteers, mostly in the early 20th century.  Most moai had hats made from stone from a different mine (the hats were mostly red stone) from where the bodies and heads were carved.  But then you've probably read all about them.  Anyway, we like your impressive snow efforts.<br/><br/>And that picture of you is great! <br/><br/>Aunt E."
