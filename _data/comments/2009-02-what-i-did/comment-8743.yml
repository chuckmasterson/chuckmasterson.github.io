text: "\"Goofy\" is still current. I would use it.<br/>As for handwriting fonts, you can just Google handwriting fonts, and you'll get a bunch (but most of them will be overwhelmingly sucky). After just a couple minutes of searching, my favorite is probably this one called Hanshand: http://simplythebest.net/fonts/fonts/hanshand.html<br/>But browse to your heart's content. And I'll definitely read your manuscript if you send it. (It might take me a while, but I'll read it.)"
