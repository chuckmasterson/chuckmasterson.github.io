text: "I love your snow sculpting -- I used to do a bit myself sometimes.  Made the statue of liberty one year.  But no snow lately.  Too bad.  And never anything quite so extensive as eight feet!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm just writing to ask you what a current kid's word would be for \"goofy\" as in \"He's a little goofy sometimes, but he's pretty level-headed at other times.\"<br/><br/>I know, I know, I may have to find a real kid to ask, but you're such a good word person.<br/><br/>And I'm still looking for the right font to depict a smart kid's handwriting.  Know of any?<br/><br/>Irene<br/><br/>P.S.  That manuscript may be coming soon, if you're still willing to read it."
