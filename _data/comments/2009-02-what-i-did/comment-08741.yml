text: "I have a shoes rule for winter. If there's snow on the ground, the following comes into play:<br/>-If I'm just going from one place to another place that's pretty close by, I won't bother with the shoes.<br/>-If the other place is far enough away that I'll start going numb/painful in my toes and fingers, I'll put on shoes and gloves.<br/>-If I'm going out specifically to be in the snow - as I did when I built the moai - I'll put shoes on. In point of fact, I put on those boots that you and Grandma got me on the way to Crowduck a couple years ago, at that big shoe store. Was it in Wisconsin? The boots are holding up really well, mainy because I don't use them very much. They're very good boots."
