text: "I just biked by the original Nathan&#39;s today at Coney Island, but I didn&#39;t get a hot dog. They appeared to be something like closed, hunkering down for the July 4th hot dog eating contest. Maybe I should&#39;ve tried bypassing the scaffolding and heavy machinery setting up the stage there.<br /><br />Haven&#39;t met any Sopranos yet. Strangely enough the person I&#39;ve met who most seemed like a gangster was in Grinnell, at a place called the Snack Shack, which is open until 2:30 in the morning and has a weird clientele. This guy was called Charlie. He paid for his Pepsi with a $100 bill, and then turned to me and remarked on that in a scratchy voice: &quot;Lots of money. FIGHT for money.&quot; But I also got the impression that he was a mostly harmless crazy man who just came in and bought Pepsis and stuff."
