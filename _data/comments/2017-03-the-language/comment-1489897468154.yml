  Wait'll you see me this year at Crowduck. I'm finally going to learn how to
  properly clean a fish. I may be spending some time this May on Rainy Lake
  (near Int'l Falls) at a First Nation, learning from the land and about the
  land, so I'll probably have picked up some interesting ideas and practicies.
