text: "in our society a name shows who you are, your family background, your ethnic,etc. Interesting right? my name is taken from arabic words. actually my dad said he took from qur'an. In my generation, many moslem babies named after arabian names or mix between that. Alfi means a thousand in arabic. Not like America or Korean name, we dont really think about sure name. My fullname is Alfiana Amrin Rosyadi which means a thousand good things (well little misinterpret happened cause dad told me before he meant to be translated like  a thousand leader in this world). so funny. So if my names translated to ojibwe will be like \"Ms midaswak\". hehe . Btw happy birthday to you. DIBISHKAA.  i got a notification from facebook hehehe.I wanna sing a happy birthday song in ojibwe language if you dont mind to send me the translation. heheheh\r\nbtw, i took a korean linguistic class this semester. Studying the linguistic hierarchy makes me realize that every language has its own difficulties and characters. Well for me i prefer to deeply study the agglutinative language since mostly the language i speak now are all agglutinative one."
