text: "It's good to hear that you think anyone should be free to learn any language. Here, a lot of white people are very conscious of how much damage their white ancestors have done to other cultures' ways of life, and are really really nervous about doing anything that would perpetuate that. That anxiety can be paralyzing and even keep us from doing *good* things.\r\n\r\nVery solid attempt at a sentence! \"I'm happy in Indonesia\" would actually come out as \"Niminwendam Indonesiaang\"---the 'I' prefix is *ni-* before most consonants (and *ind-* before a vowel), and for words that end in a vowel, the locative suffix lengthens the vowel (if it's not already long) and adds *-ng*.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., most Ojibwe speakers use the Latin-alphabet spelling system that I used in this post. In some places in Canada, they use a modified form of [Inuktitut syllabics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inuktitut_syllabics), and some Cree speakers use that too. \r\n\r\nI didn't know that about your name! What's the story behind why \"a thousand\" is used as a name? In Ojibwe 'a thousand' would be *midaaswaak*, which breaks down to 'ten hundred' (*midaasw-* 'ten' + *-waak* 'hundred')."
