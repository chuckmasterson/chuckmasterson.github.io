text: "Thanks for the birthday wishes, Ms. Midaaswaak!\r\n\r\nI think that's a fine story behind your name. If I understand you right (\"Not like America or Korean name, we dont really think about sure name\"), you're saying that people don't think too hard about the meaning of a name before giving it. I'd say people think even less about the meaning of a name in the US, at least in the white/mainstream culture, although Ojibwe names are deeply meaningful. My parents definitely had a meaning in mind with my name, but I've known of parents who just pick something that sounds pretty. Completely new made-up names are common.\r\n\r\nI had no idea how to sing Happy Birthday in Ojibwe, but I looked it up and found [this cute video](http://www.schooltube.com/video/368ba209c97e4e64843c/Ojibwe%20Happy%20Birthday%20Song) of some kids at an immersion school singing \"Mino-dibishkaa giin!\" in various different keys.\r\n\r\n(*Mino-* = 'good', *giin* = 'you'. I'm not actually very sure how this sentence works. I would've imagined something like \"Maanoo gi-mino-dibishkaa\", where *maanoo* kind of means 'let it be so!' and *gi-* is the prefix for 'you'. But I'm not fluent, so what I would imagine isn't necessarily very useful.)"
