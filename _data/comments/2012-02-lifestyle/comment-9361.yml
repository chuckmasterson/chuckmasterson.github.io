text: "Weird, Blogger isn&#39;t letting me log in to post a comment.<br /><br />That&#39;s true. I thought about that while I was writing. But my thoughts run like this:<br />• It&#39;s possible to burn wood with very high efficiency thanks to recent advances in the field of cleverness. <a href=\"http://www.richsoil.com/rocket-stove-mass-heater.jsp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here&#39;s what I mean.</a><br />• If you have a good wood-burning camp stove, it might achieve decent efficiency, as opposed to a campfire, which has dismal efficiency.<br />• And burning twigs in a camp stove is quite possibly more efficient than burning gas or propane, because both of those have to be pumped from the ground, refined, canned, and transported. So perhaps twigs compare favorably.<br /><br />However, all these pieces don&#39;t necessarily add up to fire-cooking being the best option. And I really don&#39;t know why I kept saying open fire. Cooking on a wood-burning camp stove might be more efficient than a gas stove, or maybe not; it might be more efficient than eating in a restaurant with a gas range, especially if you consider how the restaurant probably has lights, heating, and air conditioning, but still maybe not. Certainly when I imagine a camp stove and subconsciously think of it being as efficient as a full-size rocket mass heater, I&#39;m dreaming, because camp stoves are just too small to be that efficient. Maybe I&#39;m making stuff up. But in any case, wood-fire cooking is a minimalist skill and useful and probably not too bad a thing, especially if it&#39;s done right. After I get some experience with it sometime, I&#39;ll write again about what I think about it. For now I&#39;ll leave it inconclusive."
