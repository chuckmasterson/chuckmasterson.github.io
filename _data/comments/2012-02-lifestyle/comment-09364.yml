text: "It depends on how you go about it. If you do it in the traditional way, like the Mongolians do, it&#39;s definitely low-impact, because the lifestyle is centered around having few enough things that you can pack them all up, including your house, onto your horses and take off for better pastures whenever the time is right. If you live like that you&#39;re not going to be consuming much. But if you keep a summer home and move a whole houseful of stuff between it and your other house, by trailer, then you&#39;ll be consuming quite a bit more."
