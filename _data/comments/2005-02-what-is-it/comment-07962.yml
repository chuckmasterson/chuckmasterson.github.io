Will you post your fonts somewhere online?<br /><br />I'm guessing people commenting on you riding your bike is because you don't see that kind of thing much any more.  I think the same goes with people mentioning it at school.  I think I've only said it once or twice, and then only because we almost never go to school via Winton Road.  When we do the driver (whichever parent it may be) is usually the one that notices it and then relays the information to me like its hot news.  I think the same goes for Rosie who has told me multiple times how her dad has almost run you over and then mimicked his reaction in her perfect imitation we all know.<br />I think you should talk to him about the petition again.  It seems annoying him shows seriousness and he is more willing to bend your way.  If that doesn't work you could try the old \"pass it around the lunchroom\" technique.  Kind of elementaryesque like the \"Get back slushies\" things people always sent around but never really did anything with, but it does usually get a fair amount of signatures.<br /><br />As for your TV and Video games complaint, I am going to agree to a degree.  People do watch far to much TV and I'm amazed at how much crap comes out of there.  Fear Factor is what disturbs me the most.  I don't know how anyone can find that any more entertaining than going out back and digging a hole for an hour every week.  At least the latter might end you up with an old coin or something.  I also think video games have gotten a little out of hand too.  I know they are fun and its good to get away and do things you can't really do, but limitations are required.  I haven't played one probably since school started, but my brother has beaten like 5 games (most of them gifts to ME) in the past 6 months.  This totals to probably 200+ hours.  Then he has the nerve to stop helping this blind lady he was doing community service for when he needed hours for confirmation, because he is \"too busy\".  Not much I can do, so I just hope he learns the value of time soon.  I'm off to watch \"24\" now, one of the few shows worth watching anymore.  That will fill my TV quota for the day, then its off to bed.<br /><br />-Crossing Fingers for Snow Day-"
