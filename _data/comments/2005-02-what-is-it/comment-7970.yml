text: "I am agreeing all around today, which is making me paranoid.  I just finished reading an excellent play called \"An Enemy of the People\" by Henrik Ibsen, where the main character is exiled from his own community because he refused to back down from his beliefs.  Also, in AP Psychology, we are studying conformity.  OK, I am going to stop now before I drive myself insane. (We haven't gotten to that unit yet.) ;)<br/><br/>\"Fear Factor\" is garbage, and it saddens me to see that other networks are following on the damnable path of hell-fire Fox first blazed.  The only time I have found comsuming genitalia amusing was a \"The Simpsons\" episode where Homer developped a taste for ox testicles after being sent to a tropical isle as a missionary (\"Help me, Jebus!\").  Still, I have no desire to see a real person do the deed.<br/><br/>I also have observed your Winton Road travellings à vélo.  I think what spurs people to asinine comments is the fact that, like Matt said, very few people do it any more.  When I was a freshman, I rode my bike to school from the Prince Frederick appartments.  I also got the same kind of stupid comments thrown my way.  People like to target an oddity, and a boy with big hair on a bike is certainly that nowadays.<br/><br/>Speaking of such things, why did you stop wearing a tie to school every day?<br/><br/>If you don't think Dr. Tracy is going to listen to you, you can pull a McGlade.  Create a big, clapboard sign saying \"Save the Warder Nursery\" and strap it to your chest and during lunch and in between bells, you can walk down the halls with a brass bell to attract people's notice.  I think Dr. Tracy will come to prefer the alternative:  Posting a few signs and collecting signatures.<br/><br/>On the run,<br/>BJ"
