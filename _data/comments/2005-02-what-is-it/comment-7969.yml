text: "\"It seems annoying him shows seriousness and he is more willing to bend your way.\" meant that if you irritate Dr. Tracy enough, he starts to beleive you are actually serious about what you are asking to do.  I think he gets so many requests for things throughout the day that he can't bother with all of them and just assumes that you resolve the issue yourself if you don't ask again.  Thus, if you do ask again, he might take it more into consideration.  None of this really matters much anymore though, because I beleive Mrs. Hordes showed him your article and you will get his response someway or another.<br />Whats with the four posts in a row?  No matter how many times I read it, I will never understand the appeal of watching people consume pig uteruses."
