text: "Ehem, my two cents worth -<br/><br/>Fear Factor - total waste of time.  The things that people subject themselves to on that show are simply disgusting.  Ewwww, honestly I wouldn't debase myself like that for a mere $50,000.  Now, reality TV that I would consider - Amazing Race.  Then at least I could travel the world.  That in itself would be a great consolation prize when I didn't win."
