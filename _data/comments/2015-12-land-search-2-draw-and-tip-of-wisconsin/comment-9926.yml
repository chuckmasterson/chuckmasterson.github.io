text: "I&#39;ll stick with guns, butter, and a stockpile of food. If the caliphate&#39;s a coming, I&#39;ll be a gunning. I will defend your castle, you can be king, I&#39;ll be the knight.<br /><br />If the earth muffin nirvana revolution comes in like a dove, we&#39;ll melt all my guns and refashion them into farm tools in your blacksmith shop.<br /><br />Either way we win!"
