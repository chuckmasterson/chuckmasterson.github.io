text: "When you run out of ammo, we’ll be here, if you can make it. <br /><br />That’s the essential wrong premise of zombie-apocalypse prepper-hoarders: the only way they can conceive of solving their problem is by doing more of what they’re doing now (buying food) and getting violent to compensate. That mindset leads to an arms race, and even the winner of it is just left with lots of canned food and an estrangement from everyone around him. Building new systems based on cooperation with your community will win out every time over perpetuating the old system that’s built on competing with them. Competition only works when you can get more and more stuff. When there’s less and less to go around, that doesn’t work."
