text: "I randomly stumbled upon your blog by accidentally clicking a wrong button from mine, and don&#39;t particularly like when people read my blog. But within reading the first  few lines of yours I became intrigued, hope you don&#39;t mind I&#39;m a random.<br />First of all you have a very sensible approach to thinking about a topic such as this, and you come across as being very informed about your topic even though you say this is rather helter-skelter.<br />Secondly, with the start of the new year i made my first ever resolution, to only eat meat that i know the origins of. It&#39;s important to say I live on a small beef farm and am hoping to go to school for environmental agriculture. I understand that human consumption of meat is now part of the food chain, however we have taken it to a level far beyond reasonable, with not only over consuming but expanding our populations far beyond the point where we can sustain life. So, I agree it&#39;s difficult to consume non factory-farmed meat, but it makes a big difference, day six and I&#39;m still good.<br />You&#39;re replaceability ideas are brilliant, I have never thought about this so much, but you blew my mind with the talk of lifespan, age and energy! Everything makes sense, I agreed with it all, except for the sponge versus rabbit. Solely because the sponge is much more rare, rabbits reproduce quickly and sponges, just like any coral are much more sensitive to their environment. Although i do agree with the suffering, as it is horrible to watch an animal suffer. It also seems that there is the &quot;cute&quot; factor, many people would save the rabbit because of its soft cuddly physique, as opposed to a rat or carp. <br />Thanks for expanding my mind tonight."
