The people who ponder these things sit in the 95&#39;th percentile or higher of &quot;win&quot; on this planet.<br /><br />The shlubs who live in the bottom half of planetary &quot;win&quot; just want something to eat today, and to not die.<br /><br />However, as a fellow 5%&#39;er, I agree that our food sucks. What the hell is in a damn chicken McNugget anyway? It ain&#39;t chicken!<br /><br />I would hazard a guess that less than half of all americans eat ANY raw or un-processed foods in a week.<br /><br />Dave"
