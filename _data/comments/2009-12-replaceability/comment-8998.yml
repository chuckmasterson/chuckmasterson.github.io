This blog doesn&#39;t often get a readership outside of my friends and family, but I secretly wish it did, and you&#39;re welcome to keep reading, although there&#39;s only rarely philiosophical stuff like this—it&#39;s usually accounts of what I&#39;ve been doing lately. <br /><br />Your resolution sounds like a great idea to me, and if I were buying all my own food, I&#39;d probably make the same one, but my food comes from all sorts of sources uncontrolled by me (mainly my parents and the college dining hall). I wish you the very best of luck on it—let me know how it goes, if you come back further into it and feel like writing. If you blog about your beef farm, I wouldn&#39;t mind reading about it if you don&#39;t. I&#39;m tickled pink that my idea had an impact. Thanks for your comment. Oh, and about the sponges—I used those because they&#39;re the least human-like animal I could think of. They&#39;re actually in a different phylum from corals—corals are colonies, but sponges are single individuals, and I tried to set the energy investment equal to the rabbit&#39;s by making them the same age. <br /><br />The cute factor is a good bit to figure in that I hadn&#39;t thought of. I guess I was unconsciously lumping it in with similarity to humans, but that can&#39;t be quite right, or we&#39;d all think naked mole rats are the cutest animal around, since they&#39;re so similar to humans in their hairlessness. Thanks!"
