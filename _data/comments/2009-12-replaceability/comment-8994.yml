text: "In that case, factory farming of animals should still be condemned, because it uses up way more resources than farming of plants, even factory farming, simply because it takes so much more energy to make a 1500-pound steer than it does to make 1500 pounds of wheat. Less energy per pound of food means it can be sold cheaper, and the poorest people can buy it.<br /><br />However, the other side of this problem is that there are too many people on the planet to sustain without resorting to factory farming, clearcuts, and other Very Bad Things. There was once a time when a group of humans functioned as part of an existing ecosystem. Now, groups of humans have become magnitudes larger and don&#39;t work with ecosystems, but rather destroy them and replace them with monocrops or buildings."
