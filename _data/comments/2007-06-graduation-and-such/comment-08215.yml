I was thinking it would be trick to create a font with the purpose of easy reading.  maybe that's already been done?  a font that appears so clearly on screen and in print that people have an easier time reading. good luck on the job hunt.  if you could drive I would hire you to work for me. oh well, i guess you don't need that $12 an hour anyway, after all, you are suppose to be poor - you're a college student!<br/><br/>Dan, the Master of Krokay"
