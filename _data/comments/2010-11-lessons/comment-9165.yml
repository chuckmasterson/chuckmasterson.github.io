If they own it and there is a crop planted on it, it&#39;s because they have leased it to a farmer for the going rate. This is common. Farmers also commonly buy crop insurance to limit their risk of crop failure. Wait a minute, what the hell do they teach you out in that corn field anyway?! Just kiddin&#39;"
