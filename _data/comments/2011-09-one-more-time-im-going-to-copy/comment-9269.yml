text: "I think your international bar-hopping experience is the norm. It is the same way in Chile, probably in Europe too. In the U.S. there are many kinds of bars from mellow to the techno dance club type you and I both abhor. Outside of the states, you&#39;re better off looking for a small cafe or tavern. Look for a place with foodservice and drinks. It&#39;s probably the only equivalent to a &#39;mellow bar&#39; in the states.<br /><br />Dave"
