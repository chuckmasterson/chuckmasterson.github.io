text: "The blame game is always the game. I do have a feeling that fewer players will be playing the game however. Immediately following the inauguration I happened to be listening to Rush Lamebaugh and he was already deriding the whole proceding.<br/><br/>This leads me to one conclusion.<br/><br/>Rush Limbaugh has officially \"jumped the shark\".<br/><br/>In the words of Michael Savage, yet another conservative/libertarian pundit. \"Rush Limbaugh is the Boy George of the republican party\".<br/><br/>The republican party now is a caricature of itself. Don't be surprised though, the democratic party was in the same place at the end of the Clintonian/narcissism era.<br/><br/>It seems an eight year term now begets a more rotten corpse as we shovel dirt on top of an era.<br/><br/>I hope things have changed!<br/><br/>I will remain upbeat!<br/><br/>Dave"
