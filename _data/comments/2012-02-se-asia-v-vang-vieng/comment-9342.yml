text: "I don&#39;t see how it could get any more interesting that your day&#39;s in Vang Vieng.  Holey Daboley Wholey!  I would loved to have to seen the caves.  Not so sure about the death slide, I might end up as a statistic.  I am very familiar with Karst Topography  and had the opportunity to see it in China a few years ago.  Almost surreal to me, and certainly not anything like we have in the states.  As for constantly being drunk, your Grandpa&#39;s internal organs would be in a constant turmoil by day 1/2, plus, I would not have a good recollection of what I saw.  I would have loved the float.
