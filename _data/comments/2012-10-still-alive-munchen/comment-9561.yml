text: "I prefer to think of myself not as a leech but as a scavenger. Perhaps a raccoon. I feel good knowing that the food I&#39;m eating was about to go to waste and I rescued it. It means I&#39;m not just consuming more and more resources. And come on, I&#39;m eating fancier stuff than if I paid for anything! Lobster, endless sausages, obazda, lots of beer. It&#39;s the shortcut to the good life."
