text: "I looked it up on Google Maps the other day, too, and just the entrance looks classier than most things I-ve done this whole trip. Though I-ve seen enough cathedrals that I probably won-t go into complete shock.<br /><br />By the way, writing this in the midst of an incredible time in the Czech Republic. It-s fast becoming one of my favorite countries. But again, that-s a story for later. ...Not sure when I-ll actually find the time to write all these stories I-m promising, but it-ll happen. Not here because I have only limited time before I go fishing, and also Czech keyboards are weird. They have so many extra letters that there-s no room for English things like apostrophes. Their number row has these instead of numbers... ěščřžýáíé. You have to hit shift to get numerals."
