text: "I have checked out our hotel in Lisbon, and you will probably faint from the shock when you get there.  From saver-of-scrap food to savorer of food of unaccustomed luxury and plentifulness.  You knew that, of course.  We&#39;ll try not to waste any of our food there, though.  We respect what you are trying to do for the earth, and, of course, we all know that any of us would eat just about anything if we got hungry enough.  Kudos to you for living your beliefs.  By the way, we leave Tuesday and I am getting mighty excited for the trip and to see you.  Grandma"
