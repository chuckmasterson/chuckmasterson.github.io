text: "Just to make sure about dates--we arrive at the Hotel Mundial sometime in the afternoon of Oct. 20.  I can&#39;t be more specific.  We also are on our own for dinner that night.  Let&#39;s assume we&#39;ll be there late afternoon.  After we get settled in our room, I&#39;ll go down to the lobby and wait for you.  I hope there will be a bar close by, and if so, you&#39;ll probably find Grandpa and me there.  If not, well look around and we should be out and about.  We leave early the morning of Oct. 23, so that gives us Oct. 21 and 22 to do what we want in Lisbon.  We&#39;re really getting excited now.  Grandma"
