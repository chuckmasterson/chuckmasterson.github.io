text: "This didn&#39;t seem to fit quite right in the post, but people are going to say it anyhow: I&#39;m going to have a lot of fun in Mongolia, and I&#39;ll be safe. But I&#39;m still not going to make any promises about staying in contact while I&#39;m there. Most of Mongolia is literally just endless emptiness. And that&#39;s the part that I&#39;m going to be exploring. Cities only hold so much interest for me, and once I&#39;ve gotten myself a wool sweater at the Black Market and seen a Mongolian band perform at a bar, I think I&#39;ll be ready to see the side of the country that&#39;s less like every other city in the world."
