text: "I&#39;ve given the recipe to Amanda. We&#39;ll see what she can do. <br /><br />The Koreans I&#39;ve spoken to in Korean have generally been pretty impressed that I&#39;ve made any effort, I guess since most people don&#39;t. Today this included the soldier I met at the temple on Chang-an Mountain. Using everything we both knew of each other&#39;s languages, he explained to me that the one building is a temple where soldiers go to pray and do Buddhist things, and the other is a temple for ordinary people (his words). He also showed me the peaceful little clearing on a prominence on the slope where there&#39;s a statue of the Buddha and another pagoda-looking stone monument. I also talked to a couple who were going up to see the temple or maybe climb the mountain, and back at home I talked to a Korean Jehovah&#39;s Witness. I actually used hardly any Korean with her because her English was leagues better than my Korean, but still not good enough for her to understand when I explained how wrong were the things she was trying to convince me of. I didn&#39;t use Korean until I decided to ask her silent friend, &quot;영어로 말할 수 없어요?&quot; (Can&#39;t speak English?) They thought it was neat. <br /><br />Man, I&#39;d love to see Delicate Arch... so I guess I&#39;ll probably make a point of doing so. Sounds like a great trip."
