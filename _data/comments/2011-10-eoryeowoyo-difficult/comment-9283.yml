text: "I am amazed at your analysis of the Korean language.  It is good that you have a young, pliant mind so that you can learn at least a simplified version of all that.  I hope the Koreans understand that someone speaking their language haltingly and with mistakes is better than someone always insisting on using English.  Sometimes the French cannot accept broken French, they are such perfectionists about their language.  Anyway, I&#39;ll be interested in hearing about your language progress.  Being a genius always helps, too.

Went to see Delicate Arch, which was a strenuous climb.  Alice and Irene went with me while Grandpa saw some other arches by car.  Grandma"
