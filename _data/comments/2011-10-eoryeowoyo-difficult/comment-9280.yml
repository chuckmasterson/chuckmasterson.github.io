text: "Japanese has the &quot;ka&quot; ending for questions, too. <br /><br />Your bathhouse experience sounds a little like mine, even though mine was done during a typhoon. (Of course I was on the women&#39;s side- big difference.) In the Japanese hot water pool, there&#39;s an area where they shoot little jolts of electricity through the water. It&#39;s supposed to be good for you, but I didn&#39;t care for it. Like the Koreans, Japanese take a shower before getting into a bath. Always.Mom"
