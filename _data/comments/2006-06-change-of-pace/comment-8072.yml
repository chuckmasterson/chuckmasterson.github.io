text: "Re the National Geographic smell:<br/><br/>Would that be fish rotting for two weeks in a dry heat? Or are we talking high Ohio humidity?<br/><br/>What breed of fish- bluegill? bass? crappie? or plain old rotten catfish? <br/><br/>How about not a fish at all but a whale? Have you seen the exploding whale? I'll try to find it.<br/><br/>Mom"
