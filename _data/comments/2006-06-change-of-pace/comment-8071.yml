text: "Just one minor little thing--it's Aunt Ellen who is coming this summer to Crowduck, not Aunt Irene, who came last year.  Ah, it's so confusing.  Irene lives in Maryland, and Ellen near Chicago, where we will need to pick her up before we head west to Grinnell for your college visit.  Good luck with your new job.  If you work as hard for them as you did for us you will become their favorite employee ever.  Grandma  By the way, both Ellen and Irene graduated from Grinnell."
