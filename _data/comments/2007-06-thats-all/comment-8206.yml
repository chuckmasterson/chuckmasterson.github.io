text: "We're waiting to hear what computer you want.  Give us a call.  Glad you are enjoying playing croquet ( sorry--I WAS, after all, a French teacher).  Our family has a long history with the game.  My dad and your Grandpa used to go at it pretty hard whenever we got together in Iowa.  Even after my father was very ill with Parkinson's disease he could play pretty well.  Ah, fond memories.  Later, Grandma"
