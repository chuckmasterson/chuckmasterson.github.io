  Careful now, this post is could easily be construed as Christian allegory.
  Parable of the lost sheep? Luke 15:3-7. While you’re right to throw most of
  modern Christianity out the window, including the rapture which isn’t
  supported by scripture, you’re easily following the path of Origen, Augustine,
  the apostle Paul, St. Francis of Assisi and many others, not limited to
  Christianity. The simple ascetic or monastic life certainly is “eco friendly”.
  Perhaps the why is not as important as the way. Welcome home!
