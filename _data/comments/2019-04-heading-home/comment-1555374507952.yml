text: "I think to make an allegory I have to tell a story, and I'm not sure if this ramble quite counts, but otherwise I think I agree with you, except that I don't know nearly enough about those early Christians you named to say anything intelligent back to you. (I have an intention to read more old to very-old texts, though, so that'll probably change.) \r\n\r\nI'm not sure I'd call my plans asceticism, but compared to how the modern world lives I suppose they could easily be seen that way. Seems to me that asceticism is living a life with minimal attention to the physical so maximal attention can be paid to the spiritual. But I hope to strike a happy balance. What that looks like, I'm only just starting to see."
