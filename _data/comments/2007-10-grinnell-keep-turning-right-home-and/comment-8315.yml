text: "That trip in the woods sounds like alot of fun to me. The key to not being lost is preparation. I suspect a part of you wanted to get lost. Sometimes you need to lose part of yourself to find something new inside of you.<br/><br/>Anyway, I will need to find you on Wednseday night unless you have something planned. I was thinking of staying in a hotel around there and then in the morning driving up to take some pictures of the old farm."
