I also suggest you type-up your blogs in MS word or whatever you have, that way you can run a spell check, then copy & paste your text to your blog.  After all you say specifically you don't like spelling mistakes in your \"about me\" section.  Oh one more thing, I exempt myself from spelling mistake and grammer issues in this post, I'm sure I'll get slammed with a berrage of comments from all corners of blog land including, but not limited to: siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, nephews, martians, Canadian Geese and guppies.<br/><br/>Uncle Dan"
