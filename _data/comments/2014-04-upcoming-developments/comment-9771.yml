text: "I didn&#39;t study any of his philosophy, but in high school I learned his methods for calculus. If it makes you feel any better, we didn&#39;t actually read Foucault himself, we just learned about postmodernism/deconstructionism as a general school of thought that he sort of founded and/or popularized. So I guess he&#39;s new and non-canonical enough that you can get through an entire liberal arts education without reading his work directly."
