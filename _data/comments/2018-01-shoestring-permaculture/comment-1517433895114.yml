  WOW Nathanael - "Using as little money as possible is the first step to truly
  understanding the world".  That's rich and laughable after you picked one of
  the most expensive colleges in the US to go to.  Then burdened your parents
  with a 6 figure bill to spend their hard earned money on!  I bet they wish you
  would have had that epiphany earlier!
