text: "When there are no cars left, those who scavenged roadkill learn to hunt again.\r\n\r\nCurrency is a hard balance to strike. It does help you buy an apple without walking to the orchard. But it also makes you less interested in planting your own apple tree, or in wandering around town looking at what else there bears fruit.\r\n\r\nAt this cultural moment, we are so estranged from the Earth (which despite the image we all know of a goofy hippie going \"the Earth, man!\" is still where all our life and livelihood comes from) that anything that makes us look more closely at it and thus stop destroying it is a good thing. Money controls 99.9% of our lives. That's why we're so blind to everything. If it controlled 10%, 5%, maybe less, we would see it rightly as a sometimes-useful tool instead of as the only means to any conceivable end. Money won't go away completely for a long time, and depending on how you define it maybe it never will, but we need to do as much as we can right now to pry our brains out of its grip so the balance can begin to be corrected."
