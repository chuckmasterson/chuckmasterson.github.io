  While I applaud your efforts, I have reservations. Essentially you imply that
  an economy that reaches beyond the barter system is in the end somehow
  counterproductive. Currency makes things easier, it multiplies the possibility
  of exchanging goods for the goods you want, or more importantly need. Becoming
  king of a refuse economy still pays homage to a parent economy that makes
  refuge economics possible. Without cars, there would be no roadkill for
  dinner. While it is noble to make use of all things, and waste nothing, is it
  more noble than the guy who creates waste he doesn't want? I'd rather be the
  guy at the table eating the feast instead of the guy who is content with the
  scraps that fall on the floor. Like it or not, it's a symbiotic relationship.
