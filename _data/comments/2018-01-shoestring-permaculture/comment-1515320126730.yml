text: "I was so curious so searched the farm.http://www.feralfarmagroforestry.com/index.html. is it this one?\r\n\r\nI watched the Greatestshowman (well seems there is no correlation), there is a line that I couldn't agree. P.T Barnum's wife said why you need more wealth if everything is enough. What you need in life are people who love you and sufficient money.\r\nBecause if we follow our desire with money, sure we will sacrifice all. \r\n\r\nAnd I was stressful thinking about money recently. Which i felt i was really stupid. I was afraid to not be able earn money as much as I can earn in Korea when i go back home\r\n. But then I questioned my self, Does the money pay the time I left home, the time I can spend for self building, the time which I can spend more for serving God? No. It doesnt worth. Really nice post and more convince my self how to value money. \r\n\r\n(It has been along time after last comment I said I will post a letter. But I will do this month)"
