text: "I am in customer service for a cake decorating supplies distributor. So far I like it a lot. You will find the link to it on my blog. All the cakes in Walmart, Kroger&#39;s, etc. need the little cars and dolls and bells and lace to go on the cake, plus the cake decorating tubes and bags and all of that. So they call us with their orders. I&#39;m in training right now but everything&#39;s going well. I will do biligual support, and there are several people here who are also in bilingual customer support.<br />Nathanael, I didn&#39;t push &quot;boy&quot; stuff onto you but you did gravitate to those Attack Packs, which were quite boyish. However, when you got into Beanie Babies I let you have that fixation, too. I didn&#39;t say &quot;it&#39;s too girlie&quot;, as perhaps some parents would have done. <br />Your dad and I didn&#39;t like toy guns that looked like the real thing (your dad especially was against it). However, you guys did have a couple of those toy guns. Micah liked the whiffle ball type things and then b.b. guns. We didn&#39;t object to you guys having lots of water pistols. I have just never been an extreme &quot;my child isn&#39;t going to grow up with gender preferences at ALL&quot; parent or &quot;my kids are boys and will play with boy toys PERIOD, y&#39;all&quot; parent. You had your interests and unles it was unhealthy or something, I didn&#39;t discourage you guys. Not to say that I wasn&#39;t involved because I did try to involve myself in your play. But I didn&#39;t micromanage you by being some sort of progressive super-duper recycling green tree-hugger gender-neutral parent OR a gung-ho war-loving gun-totin&#39; kill &#39;em all tough boys don&#39;t cry type parent either. <br />MOM"
