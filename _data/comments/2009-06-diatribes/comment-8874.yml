text: "That&#39;s an interesting case. I hope to do something vaguely like that, not setting a kid in a predetermined gender role, just letting him/her come up with hies/her own identity as much as I can. It&#39;s difficult, though, because socialization comes not just from the parents but also from the peers (and other places), and those kids will likely be playing the sorts of roles I&#39;m trying to avoid. Another thing I read about in sociology was a sociologist who was raising her daughter without gendered toys. Her daughter got all upset when she bought cars and non-pink toys for her and said, &quot;Don&#39;t you know I&#39;m a <i>girl</i>?&quot; Well, good things aren&#39;t always easy. Or simple. Thanks for chalking me a point in the world&#39;s favor, Irene.<br /><br />Mom, you never did tell me what your newfound job is. How is it so far?"
