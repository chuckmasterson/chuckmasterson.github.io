text: "OK, here&#39;s what Mom says:<br />Nathanael, you wanted to try teeball when you were in kindergarten, but once in it, you much preferred sitting down in the outfield to get a taxonomy of every single plant around you, and you really didn&#39;t pay much attention to the game. I encouraged you to finish the season, and you did, and you didn&#39;t want to re-enroll. So I encouraged you very much in what you DID want to do, which was to study plants. We went to the woods and parks, I got you books on plants, we started the cactus garden, you talked about plants NONSTOP from about ages 4-5, at which time your obsession became Attack Packs. You never lost your zeal for the woods and trees and plants, though, and at age 20 here you are. What you don&#39;t realize, though, is that some of the other kids really did enjoy teeball. It was a fun game and everybody got a trophy at the end. Some of those kids didn&#39;t give one iota for naming the plants, and probably those kids are playing soccer in college instead of walking in the woods in college. To each his own. I encouraged you to follow your own interests. As an extremely gifted child, you had many interests, some which became virtual fixations for a while. Font design looks like one that stuck. <br />You really do have to watch kids, woods or no woods, because they DO overestimate their own power and invincibility, especially boys. We have an instinct to protect our kids and sometimes when there&#39;s a lot of them they have to be &quot;herded&quot;. Independent play is a good thing, but sometimes having a grown-up around to moderate things reassures both the kid and the parent. <br />If you have a daughter, please don&#39;t deprive her of the princess experience. Ok, it doesn&#39;t have to be princess, per se, but little girls love to dress up and that is part of their growth and development. Your daughter may or may not be content with being in the woods and in nature. What if HER nature is to play with Barbies and she gets all into fashion and this type of play? Your kid may NOT be anything at all like you were and you will have to nurture her/him in a way that satisfies what they are interested in, NOT necessarily what YOU were interested in at the same age. Like it or not, your kids may turn out ENTIRELY different from what you did. You may have a son that really, really eats, breathes, and lives teeball and IF he DOES, PLEASE encourage him and invite me to the games and cheer him on and don&#39;t hinder it. PLease!<br />So you got 2 Hebrew names. They are pretty names. I didn&#39;t set out saying your name had to be of Hebrew descent because we did consider other names, but those were the ones that at the time seemed most beautiful. There are worse things than being called a gift of God. I personally think it&#39;s a bit more noble to be called a gift of God than Sir-Yawns-a-lot.<br />But I digress. <br />I also didn&#39;t like my name, either. And I got 2 Hebrew ones, too. I thought my 1st name was too short and always wanted a different name. Now I realize how I hurt my mom when I said all that because she chose that name for me with love, just as we chose your name with love, and it hurts just a little that you&#39;re dissatisfied with it, since it means so much to ME. Now I realize how my complaining about MY name hurt my own mom so Mom, I&#39;m sorry. But I do want to see what Hobo name you come up with.<br />I never have thought about old times in sepia tones, and this is why: I watched too much TV re-enactments. Therefore, Laura Ingalls Wilder grew up in a very colorfully green area with lots of friendly folk around. The schmaltzy violins left my thoughts, though, when I tried to imagine what her life was really like. And now I&#39;m trained to understand that the times everyone grew up in were as colorful as mine. <br />MOM"
