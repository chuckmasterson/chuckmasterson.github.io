You lost and you admitted it. That’s the mark of a true gentlemen.  Or loser…you choose.<br /> <br />I want to talk about names some more.  I wasn&#39;t particularly satisfied or dissatisfied with mine. It&#39;s just a name.  Nicknames are far more personal because they often reflect what or who you have become. Well, maybe anyway. I have become &quot;Trox&quot; big surprise huh?  But it doesn&#39;t say anything about me, although I do like it. Actually come to think of it many of my friends nicknames are derived from their last name like Smith-Smitty, Neeb-Neeber, Cowman-Cow, Stewart-Stew, Buerk-Buerkster.<br /><br />Well that&#39;s all well and good, but some nicknames derived from of your last name could be disastrous for some people, and especially for a straight white guy.  I mean imagine... &quot;Bonny&quot; or how about &quot;Bon Bon&quot;, YIKES! &quot;Nelly&quot; might be cool but it&#39;s kinda already taken by a high profile dude.<br /><br />Maybe choose a derivative of your first name, that&#39;s also common with my friends, George-Geo, Jake-Jakey, Griffin-Grif, John-Jaydog, well maybe not so much that last one.  How about &quot;Nat&quot; that&#39;s what the owner of the former Maisonette goes by and he&#39;s pretty cool. Or how about &quot;yell&quot;... Hmmm. Maybe not. &quot;Yeller&quot;, maybe. &quot;Than&quot; with emphasis on the “th” would be original, but it sounds a bit stupid. &quot;Thanalator&quot; has been around for a while, but never really taken hold, so I guess that&#39;s out.<br /><br />Some people get nicknames from the names of places where they came from.  Like my one friend &quot;Saluki&quot; named after the Southern Illinois University &quot;Salukis&quot; (when he moved to town everything he wore had the Saluki name and logo on it so it stuck to him, literally). Or what about “Tex” that’s a cool nickname, but I guess it wouldn’t be quite right.<br /><br />How about a combo of above nickname origins.  You are after all from Cincinnati right? And your name has &quot;Nat&quot; in it doesn&#39;t it?  I Therefore declare and dedicate the nickname of &quot;Nati&quot; to you. Now go pop a cap in some sucka’s ass gansta.<br /><br />You&#39;re welcome...maybe!"
