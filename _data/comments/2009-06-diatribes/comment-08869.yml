text: "I&#39;ll write more later tonight, but in the few minutes I have before dinner, I want to say that I&#39;m not so quick to accept the ideas of hard-wired differences between males and females. In my intro to anthropology class last year, I did a project where I went to Wal&#42;Mart and looked through the toy section to see what it could tell me about gender roles. What I found was that, even from the very earliest ages, everything marketed to girls is pink, hypercute, and overwhelmingly motherly, whereas toys marketed to boys are undisguisedly marketed with the intent of violence and fighting and loudness. I found &quot;Littlest Pet Shop&quot; toys for girls, which were animals with giant heads and faces that were fully half taken up by giant sparkling eyes, and  the package prominently pointed out their style. And I also found wrestling action figures for boys with amazing, unabashed names like - no joke - &quot;Deluxe Aggression&quot; and &quot;Extreme Adrenaline&quot;. Is it any wonder, with a culture that gives them toys like those, that boys come up with fight scenes and girls don&#39;t?<br /><br />Be back later!"
