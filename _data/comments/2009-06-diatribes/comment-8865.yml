text: "PS: I do agree with your statement that girls should NOT try to emulate supermodels. This leads to so much body dysmorphic disorder- the base cause of bulimia, anorexia, etc. I like the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty- this is an example of a corporation taking some responsibility for telling girls of all sizes, colors, etc. that they are beautiful as they are. Haven&#39;t you noticed in Dove ads that they do not airbrush or photoshop the models, and use many kinds of people in their ads. The body dysmorphia in boys culminates in them taking steroids to have impossibly muscular bodies- they are also trying to live up to the &quot;ideal&quot;, which is nowhere near what humans are supposed to look like.<br />Having realistic expectations and roles is the key to developing a healthy body image.<br />MOM"
