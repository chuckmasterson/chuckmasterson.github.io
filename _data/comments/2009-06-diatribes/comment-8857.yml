text: "Nathanael already got the nickname Natty Snaps at Grinnell, and in high school his nickname was Neo (because he was spacey like the guy in the Matrix). He dressed up as Neo one Halloween for band and he looked dead on Keanu Reeves&#39;s Neo.<br />Mom, I thought your second choice was Laura Suzanne. But in my class there were a lot of Lauras and way too many Kellys. Since Kelly K. was so popular, she would have been the real Kelly, and I would have just been the &quot;other&quot; Kelly. So I am glad I wasn&#39;t named Kelly.<br />Ann"
