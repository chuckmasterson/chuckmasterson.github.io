text: "Ann, do not apologize for not liking your name.  Every parent takes a shot at getting a name the kid will like, and a lot of them miss.  I&#39;m not offended, but I still love your name and would name you that again.  Would you have preferred Kelly, which was second on the list?  Then you could have been teased with Jelly Belly Kelly or something like that.  At least your name is short, unlike Nathanael&#39;s.  I can&#39;t believe in all these years he hasn&#39;t had a nickname stuck on him by his friends.  Dan tried with Nate the Skate.  Maybe he should be called Shoeless.  It fits. Grandma"
