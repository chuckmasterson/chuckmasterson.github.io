text: "My two cents.  I just know that your mom, at the age of eight or nine months, would play for hours with pieces of lint on the carpet, hardly moving, but very intensely figuring something out.  Your three uncles, on the other hand, by nine or ten months were holy terrors, climbing, falling, scooting, moving, moving, moving.  They&#39;d never have seen a piece of lint.  And I didn&#39;t do the pink thing, or the action toys, because they were too little for that stuff, and anyway, pink wasn&#39;t such a deal in those days.  You weren&#39;t like your uncles, but your brother sure was.  Never sat still a minute, action all the time.  You figure it out.  I sure found the two sexes very different, and I did nothing to encourage it.  Grandma"
