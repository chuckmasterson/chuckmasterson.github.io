text: "Aunt Irene checking in again. I just couldn&#39;t let this one go by. <br /><br />Wow.  I don&#39;t know about all children dressing up, but I know that they all like to imitate their elders, and all societies have dress traditions -- special clothing worn at certain times, things that are worn only by leaders or those who have proved themselves in some way, even masks and robes and stuff used ceremoniously.  The kids in any society do play at those things and try on the different roles of adulthood, unless they&#39;re absolutely taboo.<br /><br />As for gender roles, I applaud and admire how you want everyone to be equal.  It&#39;s noble and besides, I want equal pay for equal work, for sure.  However, there are some instances when there is, and needs to be, a definite difference between the sexes, or where&#39;s the attraction?  Also, I firmly believe that some of the differences in thinking between male and female are hard-wired.  Granted that my students in drama, who have ranged in age from six to fourteen, are already partially socialized, but I know for certain that whenever I give them the chance to do improvisational scenes of their own choosing the boys&#39; scenes ALWAYS have some kind of physical fight in them, and the girls&#39; scenes almost never have anything of the sort.  What do you make of that?<br /><br />And then, of course, if in your ideal society anyone can wear whatever they want, the girls will dress up as princesses -- I guarantee it -- and you won&#39;t have an argument against it! <br /><br />Have a great time on the trail.  It sounds wonderful to me, stuck here in the city.<br /><br />Love, Irene"
