Don’t take any of this the wrong way, I’m just pushing your buttons… I like doing that sometimes.<br /><br />Diatribe 1<br />Here goes: organized sports for preschoolers a bad idea? Well, I guess you haven’t thought that one out.  It teaches them attention, organizational, communication and leadership skills not to mention teamwork, and respect for the instructor.  Yeah, those are all bad ideas for kids getting ready to enter school for the first time.  That said, if a kid really doesn’t like doing these activities, they shouldn’t be forced, that just makes things worse. If that’s the case a parent should find other ways to expose their kids to these skills and help them learn and grow. Before bashing organized sports, I suggest you try one, just once.<br /><br />If nothing else, communication is such an understated skill in the world. In my work, current and past, communication has always been the biggest barrier to executing projects with efficiency and effectiveness.  It’s unbelievable how few people are able to pick up a phone or bang out an email to communicate what’s going on.<br /><br />Diatribe 2<br />What’s wrong with Hanna Montana hand sanitizer? If it gets kids to use sanitizer and inhibit the spread of viruses… well, yeah I guess your right, that’s not a good thing.<br /><br />So are you suggesting that the 4 year old should be learning “GO” a game that is described as an exercise in concentration, balance, and discipline.  At what age should you push this game on your kid? 4, 6, 12? Ah, maybe you’re right.  A fake plastic jack hammer is probably a lame toy at any age. However, I had a crappy plastic tool set when I was about 4.  I apparently got nothing out it. And how about the lawn mower that popped balls around a clear dome as the engine? Terrible toy.<br /><br />Diatribe 3<br />Not much here.  Nobody’s to blame.  It’s simply a technology gap. Mass produced monochrome media was invented and it took quiet some time for it’s color counterpart to catch up.  We are simply living in a time adjacent to the closing of the gap.<br /><br />Chew on all that for a while.  Chomp chomp."
