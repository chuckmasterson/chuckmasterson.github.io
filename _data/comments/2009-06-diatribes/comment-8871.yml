text: "You already mentioned me as a counterexample to the tough-guy baby idea. But also, never underestimate how early socialization starts. In intro to sociology, we read that when people are told the gender of a baby, they immediately start assigning it the stereotypical qualities of that gender. When they were told a baby was a boy, they would often say something like, &quot;Look at how strong his muscles are!&quot; And for girls I don&#39;t remember what they said - something about how cute she was, if I remember right. And this is for babies - for babies, differences between genders are practically indetectible except under the diaper.<br /><br />All cultures that I know of (though there may be some I don&#39;t know anything about) have some distinctions between the roles of men and women. I&#39;ve seen it suggested, and I agree, that the main reason for such big distinctions is that men can&#39;t get pregnant or nurse babies. So they have to be the ones who go out and hunt, while the women take care of babies, or do something less energy-intensive while they&#39;re pregnant, like gather plants. This is sensible. I just don&#39;t think it should be magnified like it is in lots and lots and lots of societies, Western and non-Western alike. I&#39;ll never claim that any Native American society was perfect in every way - even if I do think they were immensely better for the planet, and very likely for their members, than the society we&#39;ve got going on now. Every society can use some improving, and that&#39;s all I&#39;m saying. I think it&#39;s worthwhile to try and get rid of unnecessary gender roles, such as the superhero or the princess.<br /><br />I do celebrate being a dude, I suppose. I just don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a special achievement of mine, since it was really you (Mom) and Dad who made it happen. I&#39;m totally content with it, but at the same time I don&#39;t think manliness needs to be all grunting, bacon, and football. Well, maybe the bacon. <br /><br />I&#39;m on my night off here, and I went to a local restaurant with some people. <i>One guy had a Crow Duck Lake Camp keychain. How insane is that?!</i> I didn&#39;t get the time to talk to him much about Crowduck, but we both agreed that that was crazy. &quot;So you must know Bill, then! &#39;Oh, you got da nice walleye, there!&#39;&quot; Man, I&#39;m looking forward to Crowduck."
