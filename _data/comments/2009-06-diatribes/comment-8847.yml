text: "Just a few comments from my point of view -- I guess I have a few pushed buttons, too...<br /><br />Our thinking is limited in many, many ways, even byt the very language we have available to communicate ourselvs and our thoughts.  Since we start out with nothing, we can be glad for anything we have.  We can be very thankful that we have even black and white photos of Lincoln and the Civil War, for instance.  Imagine if we had a photo of, way, George Washington inspecting the troops, or the Pilgrims descending from the Mayflower -- marvelous photo op -- or, get this, a video of the original cast production of Romeo and Juliet, featuring an interview with the playwright on his conception of the play and the writing process.<br /><br />All the things we have are just windows to much more.  You can consider it a kind of game or mystery to find out more about anything for which you stand at a threshold, and then start thinking to a deeper level.  Seems to me you&#39;re well on the way to finding ways to dig deeper and broaden your own thinking.<br /><br />Auschwitz is only green in the summer.  Any photograph is just a tiny droplet of stopped time in an ocean of moving moments.<br /><br />From my teaching experience:  pre-school is a little early for heavy group work, which is not seriously effective until second or third grade or later.  Lettle kids are still learning to be individuals.  I don&#39;t thinki it would hurt them to play team sports, but it&#39;s not the same thing at that age as it will be later.  I suppose parents are only trying to do what&#39;s right and best for their kids.  Nobody really knows what that is.<br /><br />So, Hannah Montana may seem like a cheap and chintzy, overpriced way to get kids to do what&#39;s considered healthy for them, but...well, when you are battling your four-year-old -- and four year olds have very powerful minds of their own, which you are shaping to the best of your ability into something healthy and happy and that will serve the child well throughout life -- and the kid simply will not brush his/her teeth without a Mickey Mouse, or Hopalong Cassidy, or Smurf, or Star Wars, or Princess Jasmine, or (my personal choice for most disgusting) Barbie Ballerina, or Power Rangers, or Dora the Explorer, or etc. ad infinitum toothbrush, what will you do?<br /><br />Seems to me the essence of life is compromise.<br /><br />Love, Irene"
