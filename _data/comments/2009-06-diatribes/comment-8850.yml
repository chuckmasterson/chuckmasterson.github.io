However, as a parent with EXPERIENCE with children, super duper active boys to be exact I really, really have to say something about item 1.<br /><br />You have no clue.  Kids NEED to run around.  Kids NEED to learn to work/play in a group, the simple concept of sharing and taking turns does start to come into play in situations like that.  Parents of small children NEED to interact with other adults or face mental break downs and hysteria if they have to recite Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star just one more time.  <br /><br />I think I nearly burst out laughing with your statement of preschoolers spending time in the woods.  Holy Cow!  You need to devote more time with little children, may I suggest a summer job at the local day care.  And leisurely conversation MAY occur after running their little butts all over the soccer field.  It’s hard to converse with a hyped up, pent up, energetic preschooler, and no, I never fed them sugar, that is a boy in his natural state.<br /><br />And by all means, be sure to go up to these people and offer your &#39;expertise&#39; on how they should raise their children.  I&#39;m sure they are just dying to hear from you on how they are doing a terrible job and you know so much more.  Honestly, I have had know-it-alls try to tell me that 1) I&#39;m too strict, 2) I&#39;m not strict enough, 3) basically how my 24/7 EXPERIENCE with my kids can&#39;t possibly be as insightful as their 5 minutes.  <br /><br />Why do kids need to learn leadership skills?  Easy. As they grow they need to be independent thinkers and not followers AKA a little more resistant to peer pressure.  The lessons we teach our children begin at day one, not beginning at 13.<br /><br />Soccer with preschoolers isn&#39;t &#39;high stress&#39; games, its running and kicking and squealing usually with delight. And if those parents were on the field with them, then all the better.  To many parents don’t play with their kids.<br /><br />As for the herding, yes, as a parent you are constantly herding your child.  Away from the street, away from leaping off the 5th stair, out of the trees, off of their brothers head, away from putting that screwdriver in the outlet (the same screwdriver they pried the outlet cover off with).  Parenting of small children is constant herding.  Preschoolers aren&#39;t ready for unattended time and surely not being off in the woods with friends.  I hope when you suggested that you meant that an adult was present?  <br /><br />Of course in the woods small children will need to be herded away from fast water, off of the high rocks, away from the ledges.  With kids these lovely leisurely actives become amazingly stressful for the adult in charge and no fun at all.  Hence a soccer field with a ball and mess of pals, ultimately more fun for everyone.  The probability of serious injury just went down.<br /><br />Item two – if it bugs you so much don’t do it when you are a parent.  Go ahead and fight a headstrong, opinionated child on something.  Pick your battles is huge in parenting.  Of how about a compromise – buy the regular stuff and a pack of stickers and let them have at it.  Then they have ownership; much more productive and cost effective and it may not offend your tender sensibilities.  If my kids needed that kind of compromise, that would be my route.  However, they don’t care what type of bottle the stuff comes out of;  guess I’m lucky that way.<br /><br />Best of luck.<br />T"
