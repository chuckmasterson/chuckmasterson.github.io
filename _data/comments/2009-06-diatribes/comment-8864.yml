text: "Nathanael, the concept of style is NOT a &quot;western&quot; concept. It exists in every culture. I am thinking of lots of cultures- Native American, African, etc. etc. etc....and every one of those has male and female distinctions. Males have boy clothes and females have girl clothes. Style constantly emerges and changes, and every single culture has their aesthetic ideal. The Native Americans in S. America, for example- for them it is beautiful for a man to stick a labret in his lip. In our culture it is beautiful for women to put earrings in their ears. As in our culture, style changes a little with each generation. I cannot think of any culture where everyone grows up sort of neuter. The Hopi, Lakota, Navajo, Masai, pygmies, Welsh, Tartars, Lapps- heck, whoever I think of have much more rigid male and female roles than in our society right now. That is not to say that gay people in such a society are always ostracized. For example, in the Sioux tradition there are berdaches- men who prefer a female role- and women who prefer a male role who are called &quot;manly-hearted women&quot;- and they can even marry and take on the role of the gender they want. In some other cultures, they are ostracized. In a lot of Indian cultures men who prefer drag dress become eunuchs and their job is to dance/bless new baby arrivals and other things. They often show up uninvited but people are obligated to pay them because if not, they are afraid the eunuchs can/will curse their child. <br />EVERY culture has style/fashion! Ours is nowhere near unique. You can do research on this stuff if you want to, and if you find any culture where most people go through life as sort of neuter people, I will eat my hat. <br />And if kids can wear whatever they want, and your daughter wants to wear a princess dress, I hope you let her! <br />I feel pretty sure in saying that most people are hard-wired along gender lines in many areas of development. FOR EXAMPLE, research (you can google this if you want) shows that about 50% of the noise little boys make at play is words, and the other 50% imitations of sounds- cars, trains, birds, animals, whatever they grow up around. Nearly 100% of the noise little girls use consists of words. I&#39;m sure you can think of why this is beneficial in bands of small groups of people.<br />I myself didn&#39;t go through a princess phase, I don&#39;t think. But I had one dress with lots of black polka dots that was my absolute favorite. And I didn&#39;t try on my mom&#39;s clothes. I did have dolls and played a mommy role. I am wondering just how Sierra or Jackie was harmed by being a princess. <br />I took Sierra aside once and we looked at real princesses on the internet and I told her they really are princesses (like of Monaco, Jordan, England, etc.) and are normal girls &quot;just like you are, Sierra.&quot;<br />There are many times that gender development is important- not just romance. Really, you can google this, too- male and female brains are wired differently. You are mistaking that as implying that acknowledging that will have women in an inferior role. Not so! I, for one, believe that we&#39;re different, but equal! And certainly I would never want women to be second class citizens since I am one myself. I have been a woman now for 44 years and I do not feel in the least bit discriminated against or the need to feel defensive. In fact, I am glad I am a woman and that I think like one! And YOU- you should just celebrate being a dude sometimes. WHY NOT?<br />MOM"
