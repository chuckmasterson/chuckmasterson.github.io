text: "Girls like to play dress-up. A lot of boys like to, too. Some girls get into their mother&#39;s clothes and put them on and try the makeup and smear lipstick all over their face. I DO think this play is normal and probably DOES has a biological basis in the brain. In every culture girls seem to do this and try out the various roles ascribed to &quot;mother&quot; or &quot;female&quot;. Boys will like to dress up, too, though USUALLY (not always) they want to dress up as a superhero of some type. This is also normal and boys are learning &quot;maleness&quot; and doing this in a healthy environment helps them identify with their father or father figure. I realize that these situations are not always the case, and the boy wants to dress as a female, or the girl a male, but in the vast majority of cases you have this in every culture on earth. Dress-up helps children form attachments to their same-sex parent. Micah used to dress like an army man or as Anakin Skywalker. No matter where you go you will see the same- children dressing up and re-enacting the roles of someone in their culture&#39;s mythology (and mom and dad are part of that mythology, too). It IS normal and helpful in the development of a child&#39;s gender identity and bonding with the same-sex members of their society. Thus I don&#39;t see anything wrong with the fact that Jackie and Sierra used to like being a princess. I know it gets annoying to everyone else around them, but it IS healthy play and that&#39;s my story and I&#39;m sticking to it.<br />By the way, I got a job. MOM"
