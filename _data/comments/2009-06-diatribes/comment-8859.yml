text: "I guess I am late to this thread.<br /><br />1) I think you are on to the &quot; I am the uber parent. Watch me raise the next ultimate rounded child while I relive and correct all of my faults  living vicariously through my child&quot;, which is everpresent in society today(and many yesterdays).<br /><br />Nobody likes a parent who can&#39;t keep their own failures between themselves and the therapist!<br /><br />You naturally read at three. If your mother could have sold that today, she would be filthy stinking rich.<br /><br />My opinion: <br /><br />As preschoolers let them be and find their own  voice and place in life. Soccer as a preschooler is a stretch for me. Tricycle races and hide and seek would be a little more age appropriate.<br /><br />I&#39;ve had enough of the Oprah Winfrey, &quot;live your best life now&quot; mentality. It&#39;s creeping all the way down to the kids with &quot;raise your best kid now&quot;. Those condescending, while paradoxically insulting your intelligence at the same time parenting rags are enough to drive you crazy.<br /><br />We are regressing.<br /><br />Leave five kids in the woods for an hour and they will have built something, created a game, or explored a large portion of the area.<br /><br />Leave five kids in a room with a TV, and in an hour you will have five kids whining about what channel to watch and fighting over the Dorito&#39;s bag.<br /><br />Dave"
