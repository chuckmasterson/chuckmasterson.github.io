text: "Will you give me some examples of dress-up being present in every culture in the world? I&#39;ll give you that it&#39;s probably present in all industrialized countries, where fashion has become very important. But in developing countries? My gut feeling - though I can&#39;t do a bunch of research here - is that it happens a lot less. I just can&#39;t see San Bushmen children playing dress-up.<br /><br />But besides that, I want to point your attention to this sentence of yours: &quot;It IS normal and helpful in the development of a child&#39;s gender identity and bonding with the same-sex members of their society.&quot; Why in heck do children need to develop gender roles? There&#39;s pretty much just one situation in which gender is of critical and objective importance, regardless of the society around it, and that&#39;s in what you could call romance. (Well, also in sports I suppose, since women have less muscle mass on average.) In any other situation, there could perfectly well exist a society in which genders are invisible. And that society, I feel safe saying, would have no power imbalances between the sexes. Women would earn just as much as men. Anyone could wear whatever clothes they wanted. In order for equality to happen, there have to be no distinctions made between people in society. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do with race, and it seems to me that we should try with gender too. So I don&#39;t think children need to develop their gender roles by playing dress-up, and I especially don&#39;t think they need to develop (and feel the need to live up to) hyper-masculine or -feminine roles, like they do with superheroes and princesses - or, at an older age, with sports stars and supermodels. That just leads to impossible goals and bad self-esteem when the kids can&#39;t live up to those role models.<br /><br />By the way, congratulations on getting a job! I told you you could! What&#39;s the job?<br /><br />Also: I&#39;ll be on trail for six to eight of the next 11 or so days. Starting tomorrow morning."
