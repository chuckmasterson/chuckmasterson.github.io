text: "I just got back from a four-day trip out on trail, and now I&#39;ve read everything you all have written. The driving current seems to be talking about raising kids. <br /><br />First off, I want to talk about princesses. There is absolutely no biological reason that girls should like to dress up in fancy clothes any more than boys should. All that comes from socialization. The idea that dressing up is part of their growth and development leaves me a bit flabbergasted. Yes, a knowledge of fancy clothes is an essential part of the development of a girl who wants to grow up and be Paris Hilton, but for girls who haven&#39;t decided to be pimples on the butt of society, fashion is about as important as a thorough knowledge of different types of light switch covers. And I shan&#39;t be raising any daughters I might experience to be pimples. I will encourage any kids I might have to follow their interests, be they professional tee-ball or fashion design. Never doubt that I&#39;ll encourage my kids in what they want to do. What I won&#39;t do, though, is raise a kid who falls into sports or fashion as a default because they&#39;re just not thinking about their life. Nor will I raise a kid whose purpose in life is to go with the flow.<br /><br />Dave, I don&#39;t want to compensate in raising my future family for what I got from Mom and Dad, simply because the way Mom and Dad raised me was not bad. The only thing I can think of that I would change if I got the opportunity to go back in time to when I was a small boy is that I would drop something heavy on our TV. (And on that heavy thing would be a note: &quot;And don&#39;t buy a new one! Signed, The Future. P.S. Really.&quot;) But I take the blame for that, since I&#39;m the one who would come home from elementary school every day and watch <i>Pok√©mon</i> for upwards of an hour. <br /><br />I don&#39;t know this &quot;Live your best life now&quot; mentality of which you speak, Dave, but I definitely plan to raise the best child I can. Whether or not Oprah says I should. I don&#39;t plan to get my advice from <i>O</i> magazine, though. I agree with your thoughts about the woods versus TV. They also apply to places that aren&#39;t as stereotypical of a tree-hugger as the woods are. For example, the local park, or Crowduck Lake, or anything. The important part is that the kid is growing up - inside or between friends - as a result. I think friendship and intelligence are more important than sportsmanship.<br /><br />Dan: in fact I already do go by Natty (same as Nati), but not with very many people. Apparently it always reminds people of Natty Light. One guy last year insisted that it must be my favorite beer, even after I told him repeatedly that I don&#39;t drink. It seems more like a shortening than a nickname, though. A nickname would be what Mom mentioned, Natty Snaps - which has something about me in it. I guess Tex would qualify too, although the only thing it says about Tex is that he probably grew up in Texas - likely not something he had much choice in. It works better if he&#39;s got tons of Texas pride. I suppose you could say I&#39;m trying to come up with a nickname for myself, although it&#39;s a little bit different. Also, usually other people come up with your nickname, but all people have given me so far is shortenings. Well, one guy gave me a shortening and then called me a &quot;Skate&quot;, whatever that means. But it looks like I&#39;m going to have to do the hard part, since no one else really did."
