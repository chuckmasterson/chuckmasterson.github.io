text: "And I will never feel guilty for buying you the Thomas the Tank Engine watch you wanted for your birthday, which sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; for you. Even though after all that time wanting it, for some reason shortly afterwards, you decided you didn&#39;t like it that much anymore. Kids change their minds a lot.<br />I will always remember you at age 2 playing with the Fisher Price cash register for HOURS. It had 3 sizes of big plastic coins. Maybe that&#39;s something like the plastic pick and rocks. But you enjoyed pushing those levers and watching the coins come out. That kept you occupied and absolutely entranced, and watching you play with that, I saw the wheels in your mind turning. SOMETHING about that really stimulated your curiosity. <br />You did not like music class at school one iota, even in preschool, and for years you refused to participate. You didn&#39;t like group stuff much at all, and the pressure to conform to parental ideas of cookie cutter cuteness culminated in my taking you out of preschool and your teacher about having a nervous breakdown because you were reading the newspaper when you were 4 and just didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the &quot;this is circle time to talk about the letter M&quot;. Then in kindergarten you were correcting the teachers&#39; spelling, and you complained that you didn&#39;t have &quot;real&quot; homework, but I do say that many of your classmates truly enjoyed Dumble the Dinosaur and doing that silly thing was good for them.
