text: "You are so right about the color/black and white images.  Even for someone like me who &quot;lived&quot; in color but saw mostly black and white pictures of myself for the first 20 or 30 years of my life, I find my thoughts altered by those and other black and white photos of the world in the past.  My biggest shock was to see  Auschwitz in 2004 in all it&#39;s glorious green trees and grass, and to realize it was that way when those horrible atrocities of WW II were taking place.  Even worse was to see the huge bin full of bundles of long hair, once vibrantly colored while on their owners&#39; heads, faded now to various dull shades of gray, brown, and white.  But it was still color.  Wars were far worse than any of those old black and white photos relay.<br /><br />Aunt E."
