text: "Righty-O! <br />Diatribe 1: <br />I&#39;ll focus on your touted benefits of preschool soccer in order. 1: I think preschoolers can learn attention perfectly well without playing soccer, perhaps by spending time in the woods paying attention to all the many, many sights and sounds. 2: I don&#39;t see how soccer teaches organization. 3: I&#39;m pretty sure preschoolers would learn communication skills better in a leisurely conversation with a friend than in a high-stress game where they have to focus on everything at once. 4: Why would preschoolers need leadership skills? They&#39;re in preschool! They&#39;re not just short adults! 5: Soccer may well teach teamwork, but then what teaches them individualism? Same deal with 6: They should be encouraged to think for themselves, especially in their formative years.<br />    I agree that communication is important and neglected. But I don&#39;t think sports are the way to teach it.<br /><br />Diatribe 2:<br />What&#39;s wrong with Hannah Montana hand sanitizer is that it&#39;s identical to regular hand sanitizer, except that it has a sticker on the front with a picture of Hannah Montana, which makes it cost at least twice as much. Parents are perfectly capable of teaching their kids sanitation without Hannah&#39;s help. If it takes Hannah Montana to make a kid wash her hands, then that kid and her family have some serious problems.<br />    I wasn&#39;t suggesting that kids learn how to play Go; that was something else that I was annoyed about. Your tool set helped you be creative, because they were just general tools, and you had to use your imagination to figure out what to do with them. Not only is this jackhammer a highly specific tool, though, but they&#39;ve provided the rocks, fixing the jackhammer (which was already only for breaking up rocks) to <i>these specific rocks</i>. That&#39;s what I meant by creativity-inhibiting. Not all toys are bad—Legos are a fine toy, although it&#39;d be nice if they made less noise as you rooted around in a big pile of them—but most of them these days are way too specific, and don&#39;t encourage any thinking. They&#39;re made to take up time so a parent can stop parenting for a while. Imagination is also effective at that job, but apparently no one believes that anymore.<br /><br />Diatribe 3:<br />I guess I don&#39;t need to argue with you on this one.<br /><br /><br />Because you will soon be the parent of a preschool-age kid, it&#39;s very important to me that you realize that I&#39;m right and you&#39;re wrong."
