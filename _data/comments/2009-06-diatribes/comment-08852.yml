text: "All right, your experience trumps my gut feeling. But I still think I had at least one or two points about kids that can stand. Like the one about thinking for themselves. I think what angered me more wasn&#39;t that they were playing soccer (shock and horror!! a game!) but that the parents seemed to be having them play it in a really bureacratic way. They would all but hold the kids&#39; hands as they had them kick the soccer ball from one place to another very nearby one. I thought it should be way more freeform than they were letting it be. I stand by that.<br /><br />By the way, I planned to be in camp right now, but 44 miles into my trip, the car gave out. I was cruising along at 70 mph, and I put on the blinker, and noticed my rpm gauge flicking up and down in a worrying way. So I pulled over at the next exit, where it refused to start again, and called Dad for advice. He was unable to fix it by phone, so he came over a little while later and diagnosed the problemâ€”the alternator was dead. He bought me a new one and the car works fine. I thanked him plenty, and now I plan to be there tomorrow.<br /><br />Also by the way (since I may not do a full post for a while), I came up with my new signature a few days ago. Maybe sometime I&#39;ll post a picture here, but where I&#39;m going there are no scanners, so it&#39;ll have to wait awhile."
