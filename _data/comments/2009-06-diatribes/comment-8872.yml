text: "Oh, I do agree that we don&#39;t want to emphaize the mindless and trashy modern symbols of whatever.  But of course every child has to be socialized in some way.  And who knows what the actual differences are between any babies&#39; thinking?  We just don&#39;t know what&#39;s really going on in there.  Thankfully, they mostly turn out pretty well.<br /><br />You might be interested in the raising of a friend of mine.  I was close friends with his grandmother, and I worked in the theater with his mother, so I&#39;ve been watching him grow up.  The mother was determined not to imprint any sexual stereotypes on him.  She gave him all kinds of toys to play with, including dolls, and encouraged his play so he didn&#39;t just leave the dolls sitting there, and she brought him to see me in the ballets.  He really liked the dancing and at the age of three was trying to imitate putting his legs high in the air like all the ballerinas.  (There are usually a few males of all ages on the stage as well, so it wasn&#39;t an entirely female thing.)  In spite of all this carefully balanced environment and the encouragement to use and enjoy all sorts of toys, he still developed a solid love of cars and trucks and wasn&#39;t much interested in dolls.  He has grown up quite balanced with a lot of interests and definite ability, and a lot of caring about people, but very much male.  (He&#39;s now about twelve.)  I&#39;m interested to see how he turns out in his teenage years.  You can be sure his mother never pressed either princess fluff or superhero accoutrements on him.  He doesn&#39;t do any ballet but he did study general dance, and he&#39;s into theater.  Maybe he&#39;s one of the few kids who would NOT do a fight scene when left to his own devices.  His use of weapon toys was highly discouraged and prohibited, I think.<br /><br />You&#39;re right, all this is socialized behavior, and we&#39;ve been arguing for centuries over just how much that socialization builds on whatever is already in there.  I don&#39;t suppose I am going to come up with the definitive answer, but maybe you can.  I&#39;m very glad to know there&#39;s somebody young and smart thinking about all this stuff.  Chalk up a point in the world&#39;s favor.<br /><br />Love, Irene"
