text: "Everybody thinks it's weird when my parents call me Brian and my family thinks it's weirder still that the whole world calls me BJ.  When I go to college, I will be known as Brian (barring some name my roommate sticks me with, like \"Cheeseman\" or \"Shrimpy\"), so BJ will become strictly a Finneytown thing.<br/><br/>I immensely enjoyed the Calvin and Hobbes books, of course.  After the party, I was so exhausted so I just vegged out on the couch reading them.  It was great.<br/><br/>Completely agree about the new Star Wars flick.  I thought the plot and action were miles better than the previous two, but the dialogue was like a knife in my belly.  I was literally wincing as I listened to the characters say some of the corniest, most recycled lines in cinematic history.  However, I thought that some of the acting was good.  The actor who played Emperor Palpatine was excellent, for example.<br/><br/>Where, or what, is Crowduck?<br/><br/>BJ"
