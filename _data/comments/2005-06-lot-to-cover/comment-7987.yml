text: "Clowns?!  How could you get clowns out of \"The Homecoming Queen's Got a Gun?\"  They are on opposite ends of the humor spectrum!  It really is quite a funny song.  You should get the CD from the library once you get your fines payed off.  You can listen to it and reflect in another blog entry before you head off to Crowduck.  I've commented, now its time for you to do your part again.<br/><br/>P.S. Did you ever schedule a time for the Greek Festival parking?  Parents, siblings, family, friends, strangers, homicidal homecoming queens, and clowns are welcome to help out too ;)"
